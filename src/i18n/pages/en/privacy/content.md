# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: June 2025**

## Information We Collect

[Brainrotcraft](/) is a free online game website that allows users to play the Brainrot series games. We collect minimal data to ensure the site functions properly:

- Basic usage data to improve site performance
- Anonymous analytics to understand how visitors interact with our content

## How We Use Your Information

The data we collect is used exclusively to:

- Improve website performance and user experience
- Analyze which games and game categories are most popular
- Understand how users navigate and interact with our gaming platform
- Optimize game loading times and platform responsiveness
- Identify technical issues and improve overall service quality

## How We Protect Your Information

We have implemented reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information under our control. We prioritize your privacy and only collect the minimum information necessary to provide our gaming service.

## Data Storage

We use cookies and similar technologies to enhance your browsing and gaming experience. Game progress, preferences, and high scores are primarily stored locally in your browser's local storage, not on our servers. This means your gaming data remains on your device and under your control. We do not collect or store personal information that can identify individual users unless explicitly provided by you (such as when contacting us via email or submitting feedback).

## Game Content and Third-Party Services

Games hosted on [BrainrotCraft](/) are HTML5 games that run in your browser. Some games may use their own cookies or storage mechanisms for game state management. We curate games from various sources and ensure they meet our quality and privacy standards, but we recommend reviewing individual game privacy practices if you have concerns about specific titles.

## Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics to monitor and analyze the use of our service. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

You can opt-out of having made your activity on the service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy & Terms web page: https://policies.google.com/privacy

## Data Deletion

You can limit data collection at any time by:

- Using private browsing or incognito mode
- Clearing your browser cookies and local storage (note: this will also delete your game progress and preferences)
- Installing browser extensions that block tracking
- Adjusting your browser's privacy settings to limit cookie usage

Since most game data is stored locally in your browser, clearing your browser's local storage will remove your game progress and preferences from your device.


## Updates to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy as needed to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
