  "whatIs": "2048 Italian Brainrot is a casual puzzle game that reinvents the classic 2048 formula with a heavy dose of internet meme culture. Available on any web browser for desktop, tablet, or mobile, this game challenges players to think strategically while enjoying a chaotic and humorous experience. The main objective is to slide and combine numbered tiles on a grid to eventually create the 2048 tile. However, each successful merge reveals a new, funnier Italian 'brainrot' meme character, complete with unique sounds and visuals. This game is designed for a wide audience, from strategic thinkers who love a good puzzle to meme enthusiasts and chaos seekers who just want to slide tiles randomly to see what absurdity unfolds. It's the perfect blend of logic and ludicrous fun.",
  "howToPlay": "The gameplay is simple to learn but challenging to master. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard or swipe on a touch screen to move all the tiles in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right). When two tiles with the same number and character touch, they merge into a single new tile with double the value and a new, evolved meme character. After every move, a new tile (usually a '2') will appear in a random empty spot on the grid. The game continues until the grid is full and no more moves can be made, or until you successfully create the legendary 2048 tile. For beginners, a key tip is to try and keep your highest-value tile in one of the corners of the grid. Build up your other tiles around it to prevent it from getting trapped in the middle, making it easier to set up future merges.",
  "whatMakesSpecial": "What sets 2048 Italian Brainrot apart is its hilarious and unhinged execution of a classic concept. While the core mechanics are familiar, the game wraps them in a layer of peak internet meme insanity. Instead of just numbers, you're merging bizarre characters that get progressively funnier and more absurd. Every combination triggers comical sound bites and glitchy visual effects, turning a simple puzzle game into an unpredictable comedy experience. This isn't just about reaching a high score; it's about the ridiculous journey of discovering every cursed meme character in the evolution chain. Players love it for its perfect fusion of addictive strategy and pure, chaotic fun that keeps them laughing with every swipe.",
