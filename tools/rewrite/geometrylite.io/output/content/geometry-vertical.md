## How to Play Geometry Vertical?

Mastering Geometry Vertical is all about precision and timing. The controls are deceptively simple, but the challenge is immense.

**Core Controls:**
The primary control scheme uses your mouse. Your cube is in constant motion, drifting from right to left by default.
- **Hold Left Mouse Button:** Your cube will move to the right.
- **Release Left Mouse Button:** Your cube will resume drifting to the left.

Your goal is to use this simple hold-and-release mechanic to weave through narrow gaps in the obstacles that scroll down from the top of the screen. Some versions may also support the **Left/Right Arrow Keys** for movement.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
You start at the bottom and automatically move up. The level is an endless, procedurally generated tower of obstacles. One touch to any hazard, and it's game over. The game instantly restarts, allowing you to immediately try again to beat your previous high score. There are no levels to complete; the only objective is to climb as high as you can. Your score is a direct measure of the height you've reached.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Small Adjustments:** Avoid holding the mouse button for too long. Make short, precise taps and releases to maintain control.
2.  **Stay Centered:** When possible, try to return to the center of the screen after clearing an obstacle to give yourself the most room to react to the next one.
3.  **Look Ahead:** Keep your eyes focused on the top of the screen to anticipate upcoming patterns. Reaction time is key.

## What Makes Geometry Vertical Special?

While inspired by Geometry Dash, Geometry Vertical carves out its own unique identity with a few standout features that players love. The most significant is the **Vertical Gameplay Twist**. This fundamental change from horizontal to vertical scrolling completely redefines the challenge. It's not about timing jumps to a rhythm; it's about continuous, fluid navigation and spatial awareness in a constantly rising environment. This creates a unique 'endless climber' feel that focuses purely on reflex and control.

Another key aspect is its **Streamlined Simplicity**. Geometry Vertical strips the formula down to its core elements: move, dodge, survive. There are no complex portals, vehicle changes, or rhythm-syncing required. This makes it incredibly easy to pick up and play, but brutally difficult to master, appealing to purists who want a raw test of skill. The addictive high-score chase in an endless format provides immense replayability, making every run a new opportunity to prove your prowess.
