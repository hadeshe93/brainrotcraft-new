Test your reflexes in this addictive color-matching challenge! Tap to jump, match the color, and navigate tricky obstacles. How high can you score before you shatter?

## What is Candy Jump?

Welcome to the vibrant and deceptively challenging world of Candy Jump! This is a hyper-casual arcade game, playable right in your web browser or on your mobile device, designed to test your timing, focus, and reflexes. The concept is brilliantly simple: you control a bouncing piece of candy with a single goal – to jump as high as possible. The catch? You must pass through a series of rotating, shifting obstacles by only touching the parts that match your candy's current color. One wrong move, one touch of a mismatched color, and your candy shatters, ending your run instantly. Aimed at casual players looking for a quick, engaging, and infinitely replayable challenge, Candy Jump is the perfect game to pick up for a few minutes or to lose hours to as you chase that elusive new high score. It’s easy to learn, but mastering the rhythm and precision required for a record-breaking score is where the real, sweet challenge lies.

## How to Play Candy Jump?

Getting started in Candy Jump is as easy as tapping your screen. Your candy rests at the bottom, and your job is to propel it upwards through the gauntlet of colorful barriers.

**Controls:**
- **Jump:** Simply tap your screen or click your mouse to make the candy perform a small jump. Tapping repeatedly allows you to hover or climb steadily.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
1.  **Match the Color:** As you approach an obstacle, identify the segment that matches your candy's color. Time your jump to pass through that specific part.
2.  **Pass Through Safely:** Successfully navigating an obstacle earns you a point. The goal is to keep this chain going for as long as possible.
3.  **Switch It Up:** After clearing an obstacle, you'll often hit a multi-colored orb. This is a color-switcher, and it will instantly change your candy to a new, random color. You must immediately adapt for the next obstacle.
4.  **Game Over:** If your candy touches any part of an obstacle that does not match its current color, the game ends, and your score is recorded. Then, it's right back to the start for one more try!

**Beginner Tips:**
- **Patience is a Virtue:** Don't rush. Sometimes it's better to let the candy bounce and wait for the perfect alignment rather than forcing a risky jump.
- **Anticipate the Change:** As soon as you pass through a color-switcher, your top priority is to register your new color and locate the next safe path.
- **Master Your Taps:** Learn to control your altitude with small, precise taps instead of panicked, full-power jumps. This gives you more control while waiting for an opening.
