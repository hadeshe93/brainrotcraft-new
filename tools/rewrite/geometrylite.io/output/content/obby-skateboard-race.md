## How to Play Obby: Skateboard Race?

Getting into the action is simple, but mastering the race is the real challenge. Your skateboard moves forward automatically, so your primary focus is on steering and precision timing to navigate the chaotic courses.

**Core Controls:**
- **Steer:** Use `A` and `D` or the `Left/Right arrow keys` to guide your skateboard around corners, dodge hazards, and line up for jumps.
- **Jump:** Press the `Spacebar` to ollie. A well-timed jump is crucial for clearing gaps, getting onto ramps, and bouncing off pads to gain air.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Each race drops you onto a unique track with a lobby of other players. As you speed through, you'll hit checkpoints that save your progress, so a fall won't send you back to the start. Your main objective is to be the first to cross the finish line. Along the way, grab the glowing gems scattered throughout the level. These are your currency for unlocking awesome new skateboards and stylish cosmetic trails in the shop, allowing you to customize your look and potentially improve your performance.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Look Ahead:** Always keep your eyes on what's coming up to anticipate turns and prepare for jumps.
2.  **Master the Grind:** Jump onto rails whenever possible. They often provide a faster, smoother path through tricky sections.
3.  **Learn the Course:** Don't be discouraged by falling. Each attempt helps you learn the optimal path and the timing for each jump.
4.  **Control Your Airtime:** Some jumps require a short tap of the spacebar, while others need a longer press to clear a wider gap.

## What Makes Obby: Skateboard Race Special?

While many obby games focus on careful, deliberate platforming, Obby: Skateboard Race flips the script by putting you on a board with constant forward momentum. This transforms the experience from a cautious climb into a high-speed, adrenaline-fueled race. The true magic lies in this unique blend of genres—the precision platforming of an obby combined with the competitive thrill of a racing game. Unlike solo obstacle courses, you are directly competing against other players in real-time, making every turn and jump a chance to gain an edge. The satisfaction comes from mastering a course's flow, stringing together perfect jumps and grinds to overtake your rivals. Add a rewarding progression system with unlockable skateboards and cosmetics, and you get a game that’s incredibly easy to pick up but offers a high skill ceiling for dedicated racers. It's the perfect mix of speed, skill, and competition.
