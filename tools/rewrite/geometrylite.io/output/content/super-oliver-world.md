## How to Play Super Oliver World?

Mastering the world of Super Oliver is intuitive, but a few tips will give you a heroic head start. Your goal in each level is to run and jump your way to the flagpole at the end.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Move:** Use the `A/D` keys or the `Left/Right Arrow` keys to move Oliver.
- **Jump:** Press the `W` key or the `Up Arrow` key. The longer you hold the key, the higher you'll jump.
- **Shoot:** Once you collect the Acorn power-up, press the `Spacebar` or `X` key to throw projectiles at enemies.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your primary way to defeat most enemies is to stomp on them by jumping on their heads. Be careful—some enemies are spiky and can't be stomped! Hit the `?` blocks from below to reveal coins or powerful items. The Mushroom power-up makes you bigger, allowing you to take an extra hit before losing a life. The Acorn power-up lets you throw projectiles, which is great for taking out enemies from a safe distance. Collect 100 coins to earn an extra life, which is crucial for tackling the tougher later stages.

**Beginner Tips:**
- Don't rush! Observe enemy patterns before making your move.
- Search for hidden blocks and secret pipes. They often lead to bonus rooms filled with coins.
- Always try to have a power-up active. It acts as a shield, giving you a second chance if you get hit.

The challenge ramps up in later levels with more complex platforming sections and tougher enemy placements. It’s designed to be challenging but fair, rewarding careful play and pattern recognition.

### Does Super Oliver World have a multiplayer mode?

Super Oliver World is a classic single-player experience. The game focuses on your solo journey as Oliver, challenging you to master the levels and overcome obstacles on your own. There are no cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes available.
