Feel the adrenaline as you surf an endless, winding roller coaster. Master a single control to dive, jump, and soar your way to a high score in Curve Rush!

## What is Curve Rush?

Curve Rush is an adrenaline-fueled 3D endless runner that challenges your reflexes and sense of timing. Set against a minimalist desert landscape, you control a speeding ball on a single, procedurally generated neon track filled with dizzying drops, massive ramps, and unpredictable curves. This is a pure, skill-based arcade experience available right in your web browser on both desktop and mobile devices. Your primary objective is simple: survive for as long as possible. The further you travel, the higher your score. Every crash means game over, forcing you to restart. Designed for players who love high-score chasers and games that are easy to learn but difficult to master, Curve Rush pits you against a global leaderboard. Can you master the momentum and carve your name among the daily, weekly, and all-time best players?

## How to Play Curve Rush?

The goal in Curve Rush is to travel as far as you can on the endless track without crashing. The controls are deceptively simple, but mastering them is the key to a high score.

**Core Controls:**
- **Press and Hold (Mouse Click / Touchscreen):** This action makes your ball accelerate and 'stick' to the track. Use this to gain immense speed on downward slopes and to stay grounded when navigating tight curves or the inside of a loop.
- **Release:** Releasing your hold allows the ball to become airborne. The momentum you've built up will launch you off ramps and across gaps.

**Mastering the Mechanics:**
Your entire run is a delicate dance between holding and releasing. You must read the track ahead to decide the perfect moment to act. Holding through a dip will slingshot you forward, while releasing at the peak of a ramp will send you flying. A short release might be a small hop to clear an obstacle, while a long one after a steep drop can result in a massive, screen-crossing jump.

**Pro Tips for High Scores:**
1.  **Look Ahead:** Always keep your eyes far down the track to anticipate what's coming next—a ramp, a sharp turn, or a gap.
2.  **Ramp Timing:** For maximum airtime, release your hold just before you reach the very top of a ramp.
3.  **Control Your Airtime:** Don't hold 'release' for too long, or you might overshoot your landing platform. Sometimes a quick tap-and-release is all you need.
4.  **Stay Grounded:** If you see a series of tight, wavy curves, it's often best to hold down to maintain control and speed through them smoothly.

## What Makes Curve Rush Special?

Curve Rush stands out from other endless runners by ditching complex controls for a single, profound mechanic: momentum. Unlike games focused on swiping left and right to dodge, your success here depends entirely on mastering the physics of holding and releasing. This creates a unique feeling of 'flow' and rhythm, making a perfect run feel less like a series of reactions and more like a beautifully executed dance. Players love the pure, skill-based challenge. There are no power-ups or upgrades to purchase—your high score is a direct reflection of your skill. This focus is amplified by the minimalist neon aesthetic, which eliminates distractions and keeps your attention locked on the track ahead. The 'just one more try' addictiveness comes from knowing you can always do better, pushing you to perfect your timing and chase that flawless, high-scoring run.
