## How to Play JUMPER?

Mastering JUMPER is all about precision and timing. Your character jumps automatically upon landing on a platform; your only job is to guide them left and right to land safely on the next one.

**Controls:**

- **Move Left:** A / Left Arrow / Click on the left side of the screen
- **Move Right:** D / Right Arrow / Click on the right side of the screen

The screen wraps around, so moving off one side will make you appear on the other—use this to your advantage to escape tight spots or reach distant platforms!

**Key Mechanics:**

- **Platform Types:** Not all platforms are created equal. Green ones are stable, blue ones move horizontally, and brown ones will break and disappear after a single jump. Plan your path accordingly!
- **Hazards & Boosters:** Watch out for spiked platforms that will end your run instantly. Look for springs and trampolines that will launch you significantly higher, letting you bypass several layers of platforms.
- **Collectibles:** Grab glowing stars as you climb. These add to your score and act as currency to unlock new character skins from the main menu, giving you a goal beyond just the high score.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Stay Centered:** Try to stay near the middle of the screen to give yourself the most options for your next jump.
2.  **Look Up:** Always scan the screen above you to anticipate your next move and spot potential dangers or boosters early.
3.  **Survival First:** Don't risk a perfect run for a single, awkwardly placed star. Prioritize safe jumps over collecting everything.

## What Makes JUMPER Special?

Its 'easy to learn, hard to master' gameplay loop creates that 'just one more try' feeling that keeps you coming back. The controls are incredibly responsive and intuitive, ensuring every successful dodge and pinpoint landing feels earned and satisfying.

What truly sets it apart for modern players is its instant accessibility as a browser game—no installations, no waiting. It's the perfect game for a quick break. The progression system, based on collecting stars to unlock a wide variety of cute and quirky character skins, adds a rewarding layer of personalization. This transforms the game from a simple high-score chase into a collection quest. JUMPER doesn’t try to reinvent the vertical platformer; it perfects it with smooth gameplay, charming visuals, and compelling rewards that respect the player's time.
