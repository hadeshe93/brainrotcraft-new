## How to Play Cuby Road?

Getting started in Cuby Road is a breeze, but mastering the road takes practice. Your objective is to hop tile by tile, surviving as long as possible to set a new high score.

**Controls:**
Use your keyboard's **Arrow Keys** or the **WASD** keys to navigate.
- **Up Arrow / W:** Hop forward
- **Left Arrow / A:** Hop left
- **Right Arrow / D:** Hop right
- **Down Arrow / S:** Hop backward (a crucial move for safety!)

**Game Mechanics:**
You'll face hazards like busy roads with cars moving at different speeds, railway lines with fast-moving trains, and wide rivers you must cross by hopping on moving logs. The screen is always slowly scrolling, so you can't stand still for too long or you'll be left behind! Along your path, you'll find gold coins you can collect.

**Progression & Beginner Tips:**
- **Unlock New Characters:** Collect 100 coins to play the prize machine and win a new, random character to add to your collection.
- **Pace Yourself:** Rushing forward is the fastest way to end your run. Take a moment to observe traffic patterns before you hop.
- **Don't Forget to Retreat:** Hopping backward with the Down Arrow / S key is your best tool for dodging an unexpected car or waiting for a log.
- **Survival First:** A high score is better than a few extra coins. Prioritize staying alive over risky coin grabs.

### Are there any tips for getting a higher score?

The best tip is to be patient! Don't just rush forward. Use the 'hop backward' move (Down Arrow or S key) to wait for a safe opening in traffic. Also, try to anticipate the movement of logs on the river instead of just hopping blindly. Survival is always more important than grabbing every coin.
