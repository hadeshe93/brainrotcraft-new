Drop, match, and merge your way to the giant watermelon! This addictive physics puzzler challenges you to think ahead before the fruit pile gets too high.

## What is Merge Fruit?

Inspired by the viral Japanese hit Suika Game, Merge Fruit is a captivating physics-based puzzle game that's incredibly easy to pick up but impossible to put down. Available directly in your web browser, this game challenges you to strategically drop various fruits into a container. Your main objective is to combine two identical fruits to form a single, larger fruit, climbing up the evolutionary fruit chain. The ultimate goal? Create the legendary giant watermelon and achieve the highest score possible before the container overflows. With its charming graphics, satisfying merging action, and a perfect blend of strategy and luck, Merge Fruit is designed for casual players looking for a relaxing yet engaging experience. It’s the perfect game to test your spatial reasoning and planning skills in short, fun-filled sessions.

## How to Play Merge Fruit?

Getting started in Merge Fruit is simple, but mastering it requires strategy. Your screen consists of a container where you'll drop your fruits. At the top, you'll see the next fruit in the queue.

**Basic Controls:**
- **PC:** Move your mouse left and right to aim where the fruit will fall. Click the left mouse button to drop it.
- **Mobile/Tablet:** Tap and drag your finger across the screen to aim, and release your finger to drop the fruit.

**Game Mechanics:**
The core of the game is the merge. When two identical fruits touch, they instantly combine into the next fruit in the progression cycle (e.g., two cherries become a strawberry). This clears up space and earns you points. The fruits are governed by physics—they roll, bounce, and settle, so a single merge can cause a chain reaction that shifts the entire pile! The game ends when your fruit pile stacks up and crosses the red line at the top of the container.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Plan Your Placements:** Don't just drop fruits randomly. Try to place matching fruits near each other.
2.  **Keep Large Fruits Low:** A big fruit at the top can block many potential merges below. Aim to build a stable base with larger fruits at the bottom.
3.  **Learn the Fruit Cycle:** Knowing which fruit comes next (e.g., cherry -> strawberry -> grape) is crucial for setting up future merges.
4.  **Use the Walls:** Bouncing fruits off the container walls can help you tuck them into tight spots.

## What Makes Merge Fruit Special?

While Merge Fruit shares its DNA with the beloved Suika Game, it stands out with its polished presentation and immediate accessibility. The vibrant, colorful fruit designs and smooth animations make every merge feel incredibly satisfying. The game’s physics engine strikes a perfect balance between predictability and delightful chaos, leading to those 'just one more try' moments as you chase a new high score. Unlike app-store versions, this web-based game requires no downloads or installations—you can jump right into the action on any device with a browser. It’s the ideal blend of a mindless, relaxing activity and a brain-teasing strategic puzzle. Players love it for its simplicity, deceptive depth, and the pure joy of finally creating that elusive giant watermelon after a perfectly executed chain reaction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the order of fruits in Merge Fruit?

Knowing the fruit progression is key! While it can vary slightly, a common cycle is: Cherry -> Strawberry -> Grape -> Dekopon -> Orange -> Apple -> Pear -> Peach -> Pineapple -> Melon -> Watermelon. Memorizing this helps you plan ahead and set up bigger merges.

### Can I play Merge Fruit on my phone?

Absolutely! This version of Merge Fruit is built using HTML5, which means it runs directly in your web browser. You can play it seamlessly on your PC, smartphone, or tablet without needing to download any apps. All you need is an internet connection.

### Is Merge Fruit a difficult game?

Merge Fruit is 'easy to learn, hard to master.' The controls and concept are simple enough for anyone to understand in seconds. However, achieving a high score and consistently creating the watermelon requires strategic thinking, careful planning, and a bit of luck with the physics.

### Are there any tips for getting a higher score?
