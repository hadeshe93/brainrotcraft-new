Think you can trust the floor you're standing on? Level Devil is a hilariously unfair platformer where every step is a potential trap. Outsmart the game, or get trolled!

## What is Level Devil - NOT A Troll Game?

Welcome to Level Devil - NOT A Troll Game, the game that definitely, probably, won't lie to you. This is a 2D puzzle platformer, playable for free in your web browser, that turns standard gaming logic on its head. Your goal seems simple: guide your character to the door at the end of each level. The catch? The game is actively working against you with a series of masterfully designed, unexpected, and often hilarious traps. It's a game built for players who love rage games like Cat Mario but with a fresh, modern feel. You don't need lightning-fast reflexes as much as a sharp mind and a healthy dose of patience. Every failure is a lesson, and every victory is a hard-won 'Aha!' moment. If you enjoy outsmarting clever puzzles and laughing at your own demise, you've found your next challenge.

## How to Play Level Devil - NOT A Troll Game?

Getting started in Level Devil is easy, but surviving is the hard part. The controls are deceptively simple: use the Arrow Keys or WASD to move left and right, and press the Spacebar to jump. That's it. The real gameplay is learning the language of the levels themselves.

The core mechanic is trial-and-error. You will fall for traps—that's a guarantee. A seemingly solid floor might vanish, spikes might shoot from the ceiling when you jump, or the goal door itself might suddenly move. Your job is to remember what happened and adapt. Progression is linear; once you conquer a level, you move to the next, with the game saving your progress.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Trust Nothing:** The obvious path is almost always a trap. Question every platform and every empty space.
2.  **Patience is Key:** Don't rush. Sometimes waiting a moment reveals a moving trap or a changing platform.
3.  **Learn from Failure:** Every time you get eliminated, you've learned one more thing the level can throw at you. Use that knowledge on your next attempt.
4.  **Think Outside the Box:** The solution might involve walking backward, jumping on something that looks like background scenery, or even doing nothing at all.

## What Makes Level Devil - NOT A Troll Game Special?

Level Devil stands out by making the player's own assumptions the main enemy. While other platformers test your skill, Level Devil tests your wits and subverts your expectations. The 'troll' aspect isn't just random; it's a clever form of puzzle design where you have to unlearn years of gaming habits. The sheer satisfaction of finally outsmarting a particularly devious trap is the game's core reward.

The standout feature is the 2-Player Sabotage Mode. This transforms the game from a solo test of patience into a chaotic, laugh-out-loud race against a friend on the same screen. You not only have to navigate the level's traps but also dodge (or trigger) traps to mess with your rival. This blend of cooperative survival and competitive sabotage creates unforgettable moments and makes Level Devil a fantastic party game. It’s not just a game; it’s an experience designed to make you think, rage, and laugh in equal measure.
