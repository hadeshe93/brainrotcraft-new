Brace yourself for the #1 rated Extreme Demon in Geometry Dash! Tidal Wave is a stunning, summer-themed gauntlet that will test your wave control and mental endurance to their absolute limits.

## What is Geometry Dash Tidal Wave?

Tidal Wave isn't a standalone game, but a legendary user-created level within the official Geometry Dash, playable on PC and mobile. Designed by creator OniLink and verified by top player Zoink, it currently holds the coveted #1 spot on the Demonlist, making it the official hardest level in the game. This rhythm-platformer challenge is an Extreme Demon, a category reserved for the most difficult content the community has to offer. The objective is deceptively simple: guide your icon through a breathtaking, three-minute-long oceanic hellscape without a single mistake. The level is synchronized to the high-energy track "Shiawase (VIP)" by Dion Timmer. Tidal Wave is built for the most elite, dedicated Geometry Dash players—those who have mastered the game's mechanics and seek the ultimate test of skill, precision, and perseverance. It's the Mount Everest of rhythm gaming.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Tidal Wave?

The controls for Tidal Wave are the same as standard Geometry Dash: a single input (click, spacebar, or screen tap) is all you have. The challenge lies in the timing. The level is infamous for its wave gameplay, which dominates the first 70% of the experience. In wave mode, holding the input makes your icon travel diagonally up, while releasing makes it travel diagonally down. Tidal Wave demands inhumanly precise and sustained control to navigate razor-thin corridors at blinding speeds. 

There is no checkpoint or progression system in a normal run; you must complete the level from 0% to 100% in one attempt. Your real progression comes from using Practice Mode. Here are some essential tips for learning the level:

1.  **Master Practice Mode:** This is non-negotiable. Use it to learn the patterns for every section. Place checkpoints frequently to drill difficult timings.
2.  **Use a Copyable Version:** Search for a 'copyable' version of the level online. This allows you to use start positions to practice any part of the level in isolation, which is crucial for a level this long.
3.  **Study the Pros:** Watch the verification video by Zoink and other top players' completions. Observe their click patterns and the path they take through the tightest gaps.
4.  **Build Your Endurance:** A three-minute Extreme Demon is a marathon. Practice long runs (e.g., 40-80%) to build the mental stamina needed to stay focused under pressure.

## What Makes Geometry Dash Tidal Wave Special?

Tidal Wave stands apart for several key reasons. First and foremost is its status as the **#1 Hardest Level**. Dethroning previous titans, it set a new benchmark for difficulty in the Geometry Dash community. Unlike many top demons that are criticized for being frustrating or inconsistent, Tidal Wave is celebrated for its exceptional **gameplay flow**. While unbelievably difficult, the movements feel smooth and intuitive once mastered, making it a 'fun' top 1. 

Visually, the level is a masterpiece. The vibrant, blue-hued ocean and beach theme is executed with stunning detail and effects, creating a cohesive and immersive atmosphere that makes the grueling challenge a visual spectacle. This combination of top-tier decoration and top-tier difficulty is a rare achievement. The perfect synchronization with Dion Timmer's music elevates the experience further, turning the frantic gameplay into a high-stakes, rhythmic dance.
