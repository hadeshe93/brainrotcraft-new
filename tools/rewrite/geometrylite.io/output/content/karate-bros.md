## How to Play Karate Bros?

Mastering the art of street karate is straightforward, with controls designed for instant action.

**Core Controls:**
*   **Movement:** Use **WASD** (Player 1) or the **Arrow Keys** (Player 2) to navigate the screen. Moving up and down is key to dodging attacks.
*   **Attacks:** Use **G** (P1) or **L** (P2) for a quick punch, and **H** (P1) or **K** (P2) for a stronger kick. Combine these to create simple combos.
*   **Jump:** Press **J** (P1) or the **Semicolon key (;)** (P2) to jump. Combine with an attack button for a powerful jump kick, great for crowd control.

**Gameplay & Progression:**
Your objective is to battle your way through each side-scrolling level. Your health bar is at the top; losing all your health costs a life. Keep an eye out for breakable objects like crates and barrels. Smash them to find health-restoring food or temporary weapons like bats and knives that give you a crucial edge. As you deal and take damage, your special meter will fill. Once full, you can unleash a devastating special attack to turn the tide. At the end of each area, you'll face a challenging boss with unique attack patterns.

**Tips for Beginners:**
*   **Don't Get Pinned:** Avoid getting trapped between enemies. Use the full vertical space of the screen to maneuver.
*   **Grab and Throw:** Get close to an enemy to grab them. From there, you can land a few quick strikes or throw them into other foes.
*   **Weapon Management:** Pick up weapons whenever you can, but be careful! A strong hit can make you drop it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I play Karate Bros on my phone or tablet?

Karate Bros is designed primarily as a browser game for PC and Mac using a keyboard. While it might load on a mobile browser, the experience is not optimized for touch controls, and you won't be able to play the 2-player co-op mode.

### Is there an online multiplayer mode?

The game's multiplayer is focused on local co-op, where two players share the same keyboard. There is no built-in online multiplayer functionality. It's all about that classic, side-by-side arcade experience with a friend in the same room.

### Is Karate Bros too difficult for new players?

Not at all! The game features a gentle learning curve. The initial levels are easy to get through, teaching you the basics of combat and movement. The difficulty does ramp up in later stages and with boss fights, providing a good challenge for all skill levels.

### What's the best way to beat a boss?

Patience is key. Watch the boss to learn their attack patterns and identify openings. Use jump kicks to attack from a safer distance. Try to save any weapons you find for the boss fight, and conserve your special meter to unleash a powerful attack when they're vulnerable.
