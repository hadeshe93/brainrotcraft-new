Master the art of the cosmic swing! Launch your orb between spinning planets, test your reflexes, and see how far you can dash across the infinite void of space.

## What is Orbit Dash?

Orbit Dash is an addictive, minimalist arcade game that tests your timing and understanding of physics, playable directly in your web browser. You control a sleek cosmic sphere on a mission to traverse an endless universe. Your goal is simple: survive as long as possible by swinging from one planetary orbit to the next. The game masterfully blends physics-based puzzles with reflex challenges. While it starts with simple, static orbits, you'll quickly face moving targets, intricate patterns, and increasing speeds that demand precision and foresight. Orbit Dash is perfect for players who love high-score chasers and enjoy mastering a simple-to-learn, difficult-to-master mechanic. It's a true test of rhythm and nerve, offering 'just one more try' gameplay that can keep you hooked for hours.

## How to Play Orbit Dash?

The controls in Orbit Dash are elegantly simple. Your cosmic sphere glides automatically across the screen until you take action. When you get close to a circular orbit (your anchor point), **press and hold your mouse button or finger** to attach a cosmic rope. Your sphere will immediately begin to swing around the anchor. To fly, **release the button or your finger** to launch your sphere. The direction and speed of your launch are determined by your exact position and momentum at the moment of release—it's all about physics! Your objective is to successfully launch from one orbit to the next, traveling as far as you can without crashing or flying off into the void. The game is endless, and the challenge ramps up the further you progress. Orbits will start to move, new patterns will emerge, and the overall pace will quicken, demanding faster reflexes and better planning.

**Beginner Tips:**
- **Timing is Everything:** Releasing at the bottom of your swing propels you forward, while releasing on the upswing gives you more height.
- **Plan Ahead:** Don't just focus on the next orbit; try to map out a path two or three anchors ahead.
- **Control Your Swing:** You don't always need a full rotation. A short, quick swing-and-release is often perfect for minor course corrections.
- **Build Momentum:** For long-distance jumps, perform a full 360-degree swing to build up maximum speed before you launch.

## What Makes Orbit Dash Special?

Orbit Dash stands out by perfecting the 'one-button' game formula. Its true magic lies in the incredibly satisfying physics-based swinging mechanic. Unlike other endless runners cluttered with power-ups and collectibles, Orbit Dash focuses on one pure skill: mastering momentum. The feeling of nailing a perfect launch after a full-speed swing is unmatched and creates a hypnotic sense of flow. The game’s minimalist design, with its clean visuals and smooth performance, ensures that nothing distracts you from the core challenge. This focus on pure gameplay makes it intensely addictive and highly replayable. Players love it for its simplicity and depth; it’s a game that takes seconds to learn but hours to master, constantly tempting you with the promise of a new high score on your very next attempt.

### Any advanced tips for getting a high score?

To get a high score, focus on rhythm and foresight. Try to look 2-3 orbits ahead to anticipate your path. Master both short, corrective swings and full, momentum-building swings. Most importantly, stay calm! Rushing or panicking after a close call often leads to a mistake. A smooth, controlled rhythm is the key to traveling far.
