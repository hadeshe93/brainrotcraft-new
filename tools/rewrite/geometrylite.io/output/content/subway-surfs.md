## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Subway Surfs the same as the official Subway Surfers game?

No, Subway Surfs is a free-to-play web-based game inspired by the original 'Subway Surfers' mobile game by SYBO and Kiloo. It offers a similar core gameplay experience but is unofficial and designed to be played directly in a web browser without any app downloads.

### How do I get a higher score in Subway Surfs?

To maximize your score, focus on surviving as long as possible, as your score multiplier increases over time. Grab every power-up you see, especially the Jetpack and 2X Multiplier. Completing in-game missions will also permanently increase your score multiplier for all future runs.

### Can I play Subway Surfs on my phone or tablet?

Yes, because it's a browser-based game, you can play it on most modern mobile devices by navigating to the game's webpage in your phone's browser (like Chrome or Safari). However, the controls are primarily optimized for a keyboard, so your experience may vary.

### What is the purpose of the Hoverboard?

The Hoverboard is a crucial single-use power-up. Double-tap to activate it. While active, the hoverboard will protect you from a single crash. If you hit an obstacle, the board breaks, but you get to keep running. It's a lifesaver for extending your run and achieving a new high score.
