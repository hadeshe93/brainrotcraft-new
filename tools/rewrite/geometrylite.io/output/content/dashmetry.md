Unleash your creativity in a fan-made rhythm platformer! Conquer endless community-made levels or build your own, all synced to your favorite music.

## What is Dashmetry?

Dashmetry is a free-to-play, browser-based rhythm platformer that takes heavy inspiration from the legendary Geometry Dash. It offers a thrilling, skill-based experience where precision and timing are everything. In this game, you control a geometric cube, navigating it through treacherous, obstacle-filled levels that are perfectly synchronized to electrifying music tracks. The main objective is simple to understand but difficult to master: survive from the start of the level to the end without crashing into spikes, saws, or other hazards. Built by fans for fans, Dashmetry is perfect for both hardened veterans of the genre seeking a new challenge and newcomers eager to test their reflexes. The game's core is its vibrant community, which constantly expands the experience by creating and sharing unique, imaginative levels, ensuring that you'll never run out of challenges to conquer.

## How to Play Dashmetry?

Mastering Dashmetry is all about muscle memory and rhythm. The controls are deceptively simple, relying on a single action to navigate complex environments.

**Core Controls:**
- **Jump:** Use the `Left Mouse Button`, `Spacebar`, or `Up Arrow Key` to make your cube jump over obstacles.

**Game Mechanics:**
Your journey will be punctuated by portals that transform your character, changing the controls and physics entirely:
- **Cube:** Standard single jumps.
- **Ship:** Hold the button to fly upwards, release to descend. Navigate tight corridors with controlled bursts.
- **Ball:** Tap the button to instantly switch gravity, sticking you to the ceiling or floor.
- **UFO:** Similar to the ship, but each tap results in a short, controlled hop, requiring rapid inputs for sustained flight.

**Progression & Tips for Beginners:**
Progression isn't about unlocking content, but personal skill. Create a free profile to save your progress, track your stats, and save your created levels. 

1.  **Start with Practice Mode:** This mode allows you to place checkpoints, letting you master difficult sections without starting over.
2.  **Feel the Beat:** The level's obstacles are synced to the music. Listen closely, as the rhythm often tells you exactly when to jump or act.
3.  **Browse Player Levels:** Don't jump into the hardest levels first. Sort by 'Easy' or 'Normal' difficulty and by 'Most Liked' to find well-designed, fun introductory courses.
4.  **Stay Calm:** Frustration is part of the process. Take breaks and come back to a tough section with a fresh perspective. Every crash is a learning opportunity.

## What Makes Dashmetry Special?

While inspired by Geometry Dash, Dashmetry carves its own identity with features that empower player creativity and accessibility. Its biggest selling point is being a robust, browser-based experience—no downloads or installations required. You can jump right into the action from any desktop computer.

The true heart of Dashmetry is its powerful and intuitive **Level Editor**. It gives you the tools to build and share your own challenging courses, complete with custom music. This leads to its next standout feature: a **dynamic music library**. You can upload your own MP3 files or use tracks shared by the community, offering a level of personalization rarely seen in the genre. This means you can build a level perfectly synced to your favorite song.

Finally, game modes like **Endless Mode**, which procedurally generates a never-ending challenge, and **Race Mode**, where you compete against others, add layers of replayability that keep the community engaged and the leaderboards competitive.
