Rotate the tower, fit the falling blocks, and clear layers in this addictive 3D puzzle challenge. Test your reflexes and strategic stacking to achieve the ultimate high score!

## What is Stack Rush?

Stack Rush is a captivating 3D puzzle arcade game that puts a fresh spin on classic block-stacking gameplay. Available as a free-to-play browser game, it challenges you to manage a cylindrical tower. As uniquely shaped blocks descend from above, your core objective is to rotate the tower to fit each piece perfectly into the existing structure. The goal is to complete full horizontal layers, which then clear out, earning you points and keeping the ever-growing tower in check. Designed with a vibrant, colorful aesthetic and intuitive controls, Stack Rush appeals to a wide audience. It's simple enough for casual players and kids to pick up and enjoy instantly, while the escalating speed and spatial puzzle elements offer a deep, satisfying challenge for seasoned puzzle enthusiasts seeking to top the leaderboards. It’s the perfect game for a quick, engaging mental workout.

## How to Play Stack Rush?

Mastering Stack Rush is all about timing, precision, and forward-thinking. The controls are incredibly straightforward: use the Left and Right Arrow Keys (or A/D keys) on your keyboard to rotate the central tower. Alternatively, you can click and drag with your mouse to spin the platform.

As each block falls, your goal is to find the corresponding empty space on the tower and rotate it into position before the block lands. When you successfully fill an entire 360-degree ring, that layer will spectacularly clear, granting you points and lowering the height of your stack. The real key to a high score is creating combos by clearing multiple layers in quick succession.

However, any mistake or poorly placed block will cause your tower to grow taller. If the stack reaches the red danger zone at the top of the screen, your game is over. As you progress, the blocks begin to fall faster, demanding quicker reflexes and decision-making.

**Pro Tips for Beginners:**

- **Rotate Early:** As soon as a new block appears, start rotating to find its spot. Don't wait until the last second.
- **Keep it Level:** Avoid creating deep holes that are hard to fill. A flatter surface gives you more options for placing future blocks.
- **Focus on the Clear:** Always prioritize completing a full layer over simply finding an easy fit. This is the only way to keep the tower from growing out of control.

## What Makes Stack Rush Special?

Stack Rush stands out by transforming the 2D block-stacking formula into a dynamic, 3D cylindrical challenge. This simple twist creates a completely new spatial reasoning puzzle that feels both familiar and fresh. Unlike traditional flat-screen puzzlers, you must constantly consider the entire 360-degree structure, making every placement a more engaging decision.

The game's magic lies in its perfect balance of simplicity and depth. The 'easy to learn, hard to master' design keeps you coming back, pushing for a higher score. The progression system isn't just about speed; it's also about visual reward. Unlocking the 17 unique and stylish 'planets' provides a strong incentive to keep playing, turning your tower into a cool new cosmic structure with each milestone. This blend of addictive 'flow state' gameplay, clean visuals, and satisfying cosmetic unlocks makes Stack Rush a standout title in the casual puzzle genre.
