## How to Play Tanuki Sunset?

Getting started in Tanuki Sunset is simple, but mastering the ride takes skill. Your goal is to navigate downhill tracks at high speed, scoring points through stylish maneuvers.

**Controls (PC):**
- **Steer:** A/D or Left/Right Arrows
- **Drift:** Spacebar (Hold to slide around corners)
- **Speed Stance (Tuck):** W or Up Arrow (Go faster on straightaways)
- **180° Slide:** S or Down Arrow (For quick turns and style points)

**Core Mechanics:**
The key to a high score is the **Drift**. Holding the drift button lets you slide gracefully around sharp turns, narrowly miss traffic, and chain moves together for a combo multiplier. As you skate, collect **Tanuki Bits** scattered on the road. These fill your **Bits Meter**; once full, it activates a score multiplier, letting you rack up huge points. The progression system revolves around **Bob's Skate Shop**, where you can spend your hard-earned Bits on new board decks, wheels, and cool outfits to customize your look and fine-tune your board's handling.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Master the Drift:** Don't just tap it—hold it through turns to maintain speed and control.
2.  **Always Be Tucking:** On any straight section, use the Speed Stance (W key) to maximize your velocity and score potential.
3.  **Chain Everything:** Try to drift from one action to the next without a long pause to keep your combo multiplier going.
4.  **Don't Fear Crashing:** Wiping out is part of the learning process. Each run helps you memorize the track layout.

## What Makes Tanuki Sunset Special?

Tanuki Sunset stands out by perfectly blending its gameplay with an unforgettable audio-visual experience. The game's most praised feature is its **Synthwave Vibe**. From the neon-drenched, sunset-soaked visuals to the incredible original soundtrack, the entire game is designed to put you in a state of flow. It feels less like a race and more like a playable music video.

Unlike hyper-realistic skate sims, Tanuki Sunset focuses on **Arcade-Style Satisfaction**. The drifting mechanic is the heart of the game—it's forgiving, feels amazing to pull off, and is the key to high-score heaven. Playing as a **charming raccoon protagonist** adds a layer of quirky personality that you won't find in other racing games. This combination of a chill, accessible atmosphere with a high skill ceiling for score-chasing gives it broad appeal. You can either relax and enjoy the scenic ride or dedicate yourself to becoming a leaderboard legend. It’s this unique balance of chill and challenge that players love.
