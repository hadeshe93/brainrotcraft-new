## How to Play Geo Rush?

Mastering Geo Rush is all about precision, not complex controls. The gameplay is deceptively simple: your character moves forward automatically. Your only job is to jump at the perfect moment.

**Basic Controls:**

- **PC:** Press the **Spacebar** or **Left-Click** your mouse to jump or interact.
- **Mobile:** **Tap** anywhere on the screen.

**Core Mechanics:**
Your primary goal is to navigate your cube from the start to the end of the level without hitting any obstacles. Timing is everything. As you progress, you'll encounter special portals that transform your character and change the rules. You might become a free-flying ship that moves up when you hold the button, or enter a zone where gravity is reversed, forcing you to think upside-down. Each crash resets the level instantly, demanding perfection.

**Tips for Beginners:**

1.  **Embrace Practice Mode:** Don't get frustrated! Use Practice Mode to place checkpoints. This allows you to master difficult sections without replaying the entire level from scratch.
2.  **Listen to the Beat:** The level's obstacles are often synchronized with the music. Use the rhythm as a cue for when to jump or react.
3.  **Memorize, Don't Improvise:** Every level is a fixed sequence. Learn the patterns through repetition. Your muscle memory will eventually take over.
4.  **Focus on Small Victories:** Aim to get a little further with each attempt. Celebrating small progress will keep you motivated through the challenge.
