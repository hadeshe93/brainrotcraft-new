Grab your pickaxe and prepare for a brutal, physics-based climb. One wrong swing sends you tumbling down in this hilariously frustrating test of patience and precision.

## What is Stickman Climb 2?

Welcome to Stickman Climb 2, the ultimate test of your climbing skills and your sanity! This isn't your typical platformer; it's a brutal, physics-based rage game where your only tool is a trusty pickaxe. As a determined stickman, your goal is to conquer treacherous, obstacle-filled mountains by swinging, pulling, and flinging yourself towards the summit. Every surface, from solid rock to slippery ice and bouncy trampolines, reacts realistically to your movements. Available on web browsers and mobile (iOS/Android), Stickman Climb 2 is designed for players who crave a serious challenge and find humor in failure. Inspired by notoriously difficult games like 'Getting Over It', this sequel will push your precision and patience to the absolute limit. One mistake can erase all your progress, but the satisfaction of finally reaching the top is unparalleled. Are you ready to start the climb?

## How to Play Stickman Climb 2?

Mastering Stickman Climb 2 is all about precision, not speed. The controls are simple to learn but incredibly difficult to master, with deep physics at their core.

**Basic Controls:**
*   **Aim & Hook:** Move your mouse (or finger on mobile) to aim your pickaxe.
*   **Grab On:** Click and hold the left mouse button (or tap and hold on screen) to embed your pickaxe into a climbable surface.
*   **Pull & Swing:** While holding, drag the mouse to pull your stickman towards the anchor point or to swing your body and build momentum.
*   **Let Go:** Release the mouse button (or lift your finger) to detach your pickaxe. This is often done at the peak of a swing to launch yourself through the air.

**Core Mechanics:**
Your journey is governed by relentless gravity, and momentum is your best friend—or worst enemy. You'll encounter various surfaces: some are safe to hook, while others, like slippery ice, offer no grip. You must learn to identify safe zones and use environmental features like trampolines to your advantage. Progression is about reaching the flag at the end of each punishing level. Checkpoints are rare, making every single move critical.

**Beginner's Tips:**
1.  **Be Patient:** Rushing is a one-way ticket to the bottom of the mountain.
2.  **Short & Steady:** Make small, controlled pulls instead of wild, full-screen swings.
3.  **Master the Swing:** Practice swinging back and forth to build momentum before launching yourself across a difficult gap.

## What Makes Stickman Climb 2 Special?

Stickman Climb 2 carves its own niche in the 'rage game' genre with its unique blend of simplicity and brutal difficulty. While other games give you a full move set, here you have just one tool: a pickaxe. This minimalist approach places all the focus on mastering a single, deep mechanic—the art of the swing and pull.

What truly sets it apart is the hilarious ragdoll physics. Every fall isn't just a failure; it's a comical, flailing descent that somehow softens the blow of losing progress. Unlike the complex rotational puzzles of 'Getting Over It', Stickman Climb 2 is more about mastering momentum and trajectory, feeling like a daredevil climber. The cleverly designed levels, packed with everything from slippery ice to bouncy pads and deadly traps, constantly force you to adapt your strategy. It’s this perfect storm of a simple control scheme, deep physics, and laugh-out-loud failures that makes the punishing climb so addictive.

Patience is your most important tool. If you're stuck, take a break and observe the obstacle. Try making smaller, more controlled swings instead of large, risky ones.
