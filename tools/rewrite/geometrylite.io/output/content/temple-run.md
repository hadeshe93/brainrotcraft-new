Grab the cursed idol and run for your life! Test your reflexes in this thrilling endless runner as you dodge deadly traps and escape demonic monkeys hot on your heels.

## What is Temple Run?

Welcome to Temple Run, the legendary 3D endless runner that sparked a global phenomenon! Playable on mobile (iOS/Android) and directly in your web browser, this game puts you in the shoes of an adventurer who has just stolen a cursed idol from an ancient temple. Your consequence? A relentless chase by terrifying Evil Demon Monkeys. Your objective is simple but challenging: run as far as you can to achieve the highest possible score. The path is a treacherous, procedurally generated maze of crumbling ruins, narrow cliff edges, and forgotten mines, meaning no two runs are ever the same. You'll need to navigate sharp turns, jump over gaps, and slide under hazards. Along the way, collect coins to unlock new characters and upgrade powerful abilities. Temple Run is the perfect game for anyone seeking a fast-paced, adrenaline-fueled challenge that's easy to pick up but difficult to master, offering endless replayability for casual and competitive players alike.

## How to Play Temple Run?

Mastering Temple Run is all about quick reflexes and anticipating the path ahead. The controls are intuitive and responsive. On mobile, **tilt your device** to move your character left and right, collecting coins and steering clear of path edges. On a web browser, use the **A and D keys**. When you see a gap or a low obstacle like a tree root, **swipe up to jump**. To duck under a wall of fire or a low archway, **swipe down to slide**. The most critical moves are the turns; as you approach a 90-degree corner, **swipe left or right** in the direction of the turn. A moment's hesitation will send you straight off the cliff or into a wall! As you run, grab power-ups to help you survive longer. The Shield makes you temporarily invincible, and the Boost sends you rocketing forward automatically. Use the coins you collect to visit the in-game store, where you can permanently upgrade these power-ups and unlock new runners. **Pro Tip for Beginners:** Focus on completing the in-game objectives first! Each one you finish permanently increases your score multiplier, which is the fastest way to achieve a new high score.

## What Makes Temple Run Special?

Temple Run defined a genre with its unique blend of controls and heart-pounding atmosphere. Unlike many runners confined to straight lanes, it introduced a dynamic mix of **swipe and tilt controls**, giving you more nuanced command over your character's movement on winding, organic paths. The constant, visible threat of the Demon Monkeys nipping at your heels creates a real sense of urgency and tension that keeps your adrenaline pumping. The game’s signature **90-degree turns** demand sharp reflexes and add a layer of challenge not found in typical straight-path runners. This combination of responsive controls, an ever-present danger, and the procedurally generated world ensures that every escape attempt feels fresh and exciting. It’s this pure, addictive 'just one more run' gameplay loop that has made Temple Run a timeless classic loved by millions of players worldwide.
