## What is Getting Over It?

This isn't your typical platformer; it's a test of will. In Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, you play as Diogenes, a man confined to a cauldron who must climb a surreal mountain of discarded objects using only a Yosemite hammer. Your singular goal is to reach the summit. Developed by Bennett Foddy, this physics-based climbing game is a legend in the 'rage game' genre, designed for players who crave a punishing yet deeply rewarding challenge. The game intentionally creates frustration, but every inch of progress feels like a monumental victory. As you climb, Foddy himself provides philosophical commentary on failure and persistence, making your journey a surprisingly introspective one. There are no checkpoints, no second chances—one wrong move can send you tumbling back to the very beginning. Are you ready to embrace the struggle?

## How to Play Getting Over It?

Mastery in Getting Over It comes from a single input: your mouse. Your entire interaction with the world is through the precise movement of the hammer. 

**Basic Controls**:
Move your mouse to swing the hammer in a 360-degree arc around your character. The hammer's head will physically interact with every object it touches, allowing you to push, pull, and hook your way up.

**Core Mechanics**:
The hammer is your everything. You'll need to learn how to:
- **Push**: Plant the hammer against a surface and move the mouse to propel yourself upwards or sideways.
- **Pull**: Hook the hammer's claw onto an edge or object and drag yourself towards it.
- **Swing**: Build momentum by swinging the hammer to launch yourself across gaps.

**Progression and Beginner Tips**:
There are no levels or save points. The game is one continuous, brutal climb. For beginners, remember that **patience is paramount**. Rushed, frantic movements will almost always lead to a fall. Make small, deliberate adjustments and learn to control your momentum. Use the cauldron you sit in to brace against walls, giving you a stable pivot point. Don't be afraid to fail; every fall teaches you something about the physics and the terrain.
