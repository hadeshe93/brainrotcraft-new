How far can you drive with a fragile egg on your roof? Test your patience and precision in this addicting physics-based driving challenge that's all about balance!

## What is Eggy Car?

Eggy Car is a charming and deceptively challenging 2D side-scrolling driving game that puts your finesse to the test. Unlike traditional racing games, your goal isn't speed—it's survival. Played directly in your web browser on desktop or mobile, the game tasks you with a simple yet nerve-wracking objective: transport a single, very fragile egg on top of your car for as long as possible across treacherous, hilly terrain. The core of the game is its sensitive physics engine, where every bump, incline, and change in speed threatens to send your precious cargo tumbling. Eggy Car is designed for casual players of all ages who love a simple-to-learn but hard-to-master challenge. It’s the perfect 'one more try' game that will have you hooked as you chase that new high score, one careful inch at a time.

## How to Play Eggy Car?

Getting started in Eggy Car is simple, but mastering it is a true test of skill. Your goal is to drive as far as you can without letting the egg fall off your car.

**Controls:**
- **Gas/Accelerate:** Press the Right Arrow key or the 'D' key.
- **Brake/Reverse:** Press the Left Arrow key or the 'A' key.
- **Mobile:** Use the on-screen buttons for gas and brake.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
The entire game revolves around physics. When you accelerate, the egg rolls toward the back of your car. When you brake, it rolls forward. Going over hills will launch it into the air. Your mission is to constantly balance these forces by carefully managing your speed. As you drive, you'll find coins scattered along the path. Collect as many as you can!

**Progression & Unlocks:**
The coins you collect can be spent in the garage to unlock a variety of new and quirky vehicles. Each car, from a sporty convertible to a long, stable bus, has a different size, shape, and handling characteristic. This adds a layer of strategy, as a new vehicle can completely change how you approach the terrain.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Feather the Throttle:** Use short, gentle taps on the gas instead of holding it down.
2.  **Use Brakes to Adjust:** Tap the brake/reverse to shift the egg's weight forward, especially when going downhill.
3.  **Crest Hills Slowly:** Ease off the gas before reaching the peak of a hill to prevent the egg from getting airtime.
4.  **Grab Power-ups:** Keep an eye out for special items like the 'Freeze' power-up, which temporarily glues the egg to your car, allowing for a few seconds of worry-free driving.

## What Makes Eggy Car Special?

Eggy Car stands out by turning the driving genre on its head. Instead of rewarding high speed and risky maneuvers, it celebrates patience, precision, and delicate control. The true genius lies in its single-minded focus on one simple mechanic: balancing the egg. This creates a unique kind of tension that is both frustrating and incredibly addictive.

What makes players come back for 'just one more try' is the brilliant physics engine. Every failure feels fair and educational, teaching you a little more about how to handle the next hill or descent. The progression system, where you unlock different cars, adds fantastic replay value. Switching from a tiny, bouncy car to a long, stable truck fundamentally changes your strategy, keeping the gameplay fresh. It's this perfect blend of minimalist design, deep physical challenge, and rewarding progression that makes Eggy Car a beloved classic in the world of casual web games.
