## How to Play Doodle Cricket?

Doodle Cricket is famous for its simple, one-button controls, but mastering it requires timing and focus.

**Basic Controls & Objective:**
- **To Bat:** Simply tap your screen or click your mouse button to swing the bat.
- **Your Goal:** The aim is to hit the ball and score runs. The game ends the moment you are dismissed, so your goal is to set the highest score you can in a single wicket.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
When the game starts, a snail bowler will wind up and deliver the ball. Your job is to time your swing to make contact. If you hit the ball past the fielders, you'll score runs (1, 2, 4, or 6). If you miss the ball and it hits your stumps, you're 'bowled' out. If you hit the ball and one of the snail fielders catches it in the air, you're 'caught' out. In either case, the game is over.

**Progression & Beginner Tips:**
- **Watch the Bowler:** Pay close attention to the snail's wind-up animation. This is your first clue about the timing.
- **Pacing Increases:** The game starts slow, but as your score climbs, the bowlers get faster and introduce tricky spins. The key to a high score is adapting to this increasing difficulty.
- **Patience is a Virtue:** Don't get trigger-happy. Wait for the ball to get close before swinging. Swinging too early is the most common way to get out.
- **Celebrate Milestones:** The game acknowledges your achievements with fun little animations when you reach 50 or 100 runs, encouraging you to push for the next milestone!

This whimsical theme makes the game approachable and fun for everyone.

What truly sets it apart is its extreme accessibility. Designed to be incredibly lightweight, the game loads instantly in any browser on any device, from a high-end PC to a budget smartphone on a slow network. This 'zero barrier to entry' design, combined with the 'just one more try' gameplay loop, makes it incredibly addictive. The immediate feedback of a huge six or a sudden dismissal keeps players constantly engaged and chasing a new personal best. It's not about complex rules; it’s about pure, unadulterated fun and reaction-based skill.
