Test your reflexes in a fast-paced platformer where every jump counts! Outrun the encroaching darkness and conquer dozens of precision-based, minimalist levels.

## What is Boxel Rebound?

Boxel Rebound is a high-skill, minimalist platformer that challenges your timing, reflexes, and patience. Played in your web browser, this game puts you in control of a simple cube with one critical objective: reach the end of the level without being consumed by the relentless black wall constantly advancing from the left. This unique mechanic blends traditional platforming with the urgency of an auto-runner, creating a tense and addictive experience. The game is designed for players who love a good challenge and find satisfaction in mastering difficult stages, similar to titles like Geometry Dash or The Impossible Game. With 50 official levels of escalating difficulty and a vibrant community creating countless more, Boxel Rebound offers a nearly endless supply of pixel-perfect puzzles to solve. It’s a true test of skill, where every mistake is a lesson and every victory is hard-earned.

## How to Play Boxel Rebound?

The controls in Boxel Rebound are deceptively simple: tap your screen, click your mouse, or press the spacebar to make your cube jump. However, mastery lies in the details. The duration of your press determines the height of your jump—a quick tap results in a short hop, while a longer hold sends you soaring. This nuanced control is essential for navigating the game's treacherous environments.

Your primary goal is to guide the cube from the start to the end portal of each level. Along the way, you'll encounter deadly spikes, bottomless pits, and other hazards. The biggest threat is the ever-present black wall pushing you forward; if it catches you, or if you hit a spike, you instantly restart the level. Pay attention to special blocks: blue blocks act as trampolines, launching you higher, while other platforms may crumble after you touch them. 

Progression is linear through the 50 official levels, each one more complex than the last. For beginners, focus on learning jump control and memorizing level layouts. Don't be afraid to fail—repetition is key to building muscle memory. Look ahead to anticipate upcoming obstacles and plan your jumps accordingly. Success is about finding the rhythm of each stage.

## What Makes Boxel Rebound Special?

Boxel Rebound stands out from other platformers with its brilliant combination of minimalism and high-stakes tension. Its most defining feature is the 'Wall of Death,' a constantly advancing black void that forces you to think and act quickly. This eliminates the ability to stop and strategize, turning every level into a thrilling, fast-paced reflex test.

The game's physics engine is another key element. It’s not just about jumping; it’s about *how* you jump. The sensitive, duration-based jump mechanic provides a deep level of control that is easy to learn but difficult to master, making each successful maneuver incredibly rewarding. 

Perhaps its greatest strength is the built-in Level Editor. Beyond the 50 challenging official levels, players have access to a powerful tool to create and share their own devious creations using simple level codes. This has fostered a massive community and ensures that the game has virtually infinite replayability, long after the main campaign is complete.
