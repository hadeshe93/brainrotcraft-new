## How to Play Basketball Legends?

Getting into the action is simple, but mastering the court takes skill. Your goal is to score more points than your opponent in a timed match. Use your movement keys to run and jump, position yourself for shots, and defend your hoop.

**Controls:**
*   **Player 1:** Use **WASD** to move and jump. Press **V** to shoot or dunk, and **X** to unleash your Supershot. Use **S** to block opponents or pump fake.
*   **Player 2:** Use the **Arrow Keys** to move and jump. Press **K** to shoot or dunk, and **L** for your Supershot. Use the **Down Arrow** to block or pump fake.

**Game Mechanics:**
As you play, a power bar at the top of the screen fills up. Once full, you can activate your character's unique **Supershot**, an almost unstoppable special move that guarantees a score. Offensively, get close to the basket to perform a powerful dunk. Defensively, jump and press your block key to swat away shots or slap the ball from your opponent's hands.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Defense Wins Games:** Don't just focus on scoring. A well-timed block can turn the tide of the match.
*   **Use the Pump Fake:** Press your block/pump key while on offense to fake a shot and make your opponent jump, leaving the lane open for an easy score.
*   **Save Your Supershot:** Wait for a critical moment to use your Supershot, like when you need to tie the game or seal a victory.

## What Makes Basketball Legends Special?

Basketball Legends stands out by perfectly blending simplicity with competitive, over-the-top fun. Unlike complex basketball simulators, it's an arcade-style game you can master in minutes.

This feature adds a layer of strategy beyond simple shooting and blocking. The game truly shines in its local 2-player mode, offering an incredibly fun and accessible head-to-head experience on a single keyboard. It captures the spirit of classic arcade sports titles like NBA Jam, focusing on high-flying dunks, powerful blocks, and fast-paced action. It's the go-to game for anyone craving instant basketball excitement without the commitment of a full-scale sports title.
