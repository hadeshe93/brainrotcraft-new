## How to Play Blox Obby: Tower of Hell?

Mastering the tower requires fluid movement and quick thinking. Get comfortable with the controls to stand a chance against the treacherous climb.

**Controls:**
- **Move:** WASD or Arrow Keys
- **Jump:** Spacebar
- **Sprint/Dash:** Shift Key
- **Camera:** Move your mouse to look around and plan your next move.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
At the start of each round, a new, randomly generated tower is created for you and everyone else in the lobby. A timer, typically 8 minutes long, begins to count down. Your one and only goal is to reach the vibrant purple pad at the very top before time runs out. As you climb, you'll face a variety of obstacles, from simple jumps and narrow walkways to spinning platforms, laser grids, and disappearing blocks. Remember, there are no checkpoints. Falling at any point means a complete reset to the bottom of the tower, forcing you to restart your climb from scratch. 

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Patience Over Speed:** Don't rush! The timer is more generous than it seems. Take a moment to study each obstacle before attempting it.
2.  **Master Your Camera:** Always look before you leap. Angle your camera to see exactly where you need to land. Good camera control is non-negotiable.
3.  **Strategic Sprinting:** The Shift key isn't just for running. Use it to get a speed boost for clearing long gaps, but be careful not to overshoot your landing on smaller platforms.
4.  **Observe and Learn:** Watch how more experienced players tackle difficult sections. You can learn new routes and techniques just by spectating.
