## How to Play 99 Nights in the Forest?

Your survival depends on a simple yet demanding day-night cycle. Master the controls and mechanics to make it through.

**Basic Controls:**

- **Movement:** WASD Keys
- **Interact/Attack/Place:** Left Mouse Button (LMB)
- **Drop/Cancel Placement:** Right Mouse Button (RMB)
- **Inventory:** 'E' Key
- **Crafting Menu:** 'C' Key
- **Hotbar Selection:** 1-9 Keys or Mouse Wheel

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your first priority is to craft a Workbench, which unlocks essential building recipes. During the day, gather as many resources as possible—chop trees for wood and mine rocks for stone. As night approaches, your focus must shift to defense. Build walls, a door, and a campfire to provide light and a safe zone. Enemies will attack your structures to get to you, so reinforcing your base is critical. Each night, the number and strength of enemies increase, demanding better defenses and weapons. Progress by crafting stronger tools to gather resources faster and more advanced defenses like spikes to damage incoming foes.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Location is Key:** Build your initial base near a dense cluster of trees, rocks, and berry bushes to minimize travel time.
2.  **Spikes are Your Best Friend:** Place rows of wooden spikes around your walls. They are your most effective early-game defense, dealing damage to any enemy that touches them.
3.  **Stay in the Light:** Do not wander far from your campfire at night. Darkness hides enemies and makes you an easy target.
4.  **Upgrade Tools Early:** Craft a stone axe and pickaxe as soon as you can. The faster you gather resources, the more time you have to build before nightfall.
