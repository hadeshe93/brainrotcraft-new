## How to Play Snow Road?

Getting started in Snow Road is simple: guide your sled down the mountain for the longest distance possible without crashing. The slope is endless and procedurally generated, meaning every run presents a unique challenge.

**Controls:**
The controls are intuitive, giving you precise command over your sled.
- **Steer:** Use the `A/D` keys or the `Left/Right Arrow` keys to steer your sled.
- **Jump:** Press the `Spacebar` to leap into the air. This is crucial for clearing low-lying rocks or jumping over gaps.

**Game Mechanics:**
Your run ends instantly if you collide with an obstacle like a tree or a rock. Your score is based on the distance you travel. Along the way, you'll see brightly colored presents. Steer into them to collect them.

**Progression & Unlocks:**
These presents are your in-game currency. Accumulate them across your runs and visit the in-game shop to unlock a fun collection of new sleds, each with a unique design. While they are cosmetic, unlocking them is a great way to mark your progress.

**Beginner Tips:**
- **Look Ahead:** Always keep your eyes focused further down the slope to anticipate upcoming obstacles and turns.
- **Small Adjustments:** Avoid sharp, sudden turns. Use small, controlled movements to stay on a clear path.
- **Conserve Jumps:** Don't jump unnecessarily. Save it for when you're about to hit a rock you can't steer around.
