You're trapped in a narrow corridor with an endless horde of the undead. Aim true, manage your ammo, and kick for your life to survive the nonstop onslaught.

## What is Undead Corridor?

Undead Corridor is an intense, fast-paced 2D arcade shooter built for pure survival. Available as a web-browser game, it throws you directly into the action with no story, no exploration—just you, your guns, and a claustrophobic hallway swarming with zombies from both sides. Your single objective is to survive for as long as possible against increasingly difficult waves of the undead. The game's simple premise and pixelated art style appeal to fans of classic arcade action and anyone looking for a quick, high-stakes challenge. As you take down zombies, you'll earn cash to unlock a powerful arsenal of weapons, giving you a fighting chance to beat your high score in the next run. It’s all about reflexes, resource management, and your ability to stay calm under extreme pressure.

## How to Play Undead Corridor?

The goal in Undead Corridor is to survive by eliminating zombies approaching from the left and right. You are stationary in the center of the screen, so your focus is entirely on aiming, shooting, and managing your resources.

**Core Controls (PC/Web):**

- **Aim & Fire:** Move your mouse to aim and click to shoot.
- **Reload:** Press the 'R' key. Don't wait until your clip is empty; reload during any brief pause in the action.
- **Kick:** Press the 'Spacebar' to kick enemies back. This is your most crucial defensive tool. It pushes back entire groups, giving you vital seconds to reload or switch weapons.
- **Switch Weapon:** Press the 'Q' key to cycle through your available firearms.

**Gameplay Loop & Progression:**
Each zombie you defeat drops cash. Survive the wave (or die trying) and use this cash in the main menu to buy new weapons like shotguns, SMGs, and assault rifles. These unlocks are permanent, so every run helps you build a better arsenal for the future. Waves get progressively harder, introducing faster and tougher zombie types that will quickly overwhelm you if you're not prepared.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Master the Kick:** Your kick is your best friend. Use it proactively to control crowds, not just as a last resort.
2.  **Strategic Reloads:** The time it takes to reload can be fatal. Kick a group away, then immediately hit 'R'.
3.  **Conserve Ammo:** Use your basic pistol for single, weak zombies to save powerful ammo for dense swarms.

## What Makes Undead Corridor Special?

Undead Corridor stands out through its brutal simplicity and claustrophobic design. Unlike other shooters where you can run and kite enemies, this game locks you in a tight space, turning the pressure up to eleven. This singular focus on aiming and reaction time creates a pure, distilled arcade experience.

The game's strategic depth comes from its kick mechanic. It’s not just a melee attack; it’s a primary crowd-control tool that is essential for survival and must be mastered. This elevates the gameplay beyond a simple point-and-shoot. Furthermore, the tangible progression system, where you permanently unlock new weapons with cash earned in each run, provides a powerful 'one more try' incentive. Even a short, failed attempt contributes to your long-term goal of unlocking that powerful shotgun or rifle, making every second of gameplay feel rewarding.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Undead Corridor available on mobile devices?

Undead Corridor is primarily designed as a browser game for PC, utilizing a keyboard and mouse for optimal control and precision. While it might load on some mobile browsers, the experience is not optimized for touchscreens, and you'll have a much better time playing on a desktop.

### How difficult is Undead Corridor?

The game is easy to learn but very hard to master. It features a steep difficulty curve where the initial waves serve as a warm-up before the horde quickly becomes faster, denser, and more aggressive. It's designed to be a tough, reflex-based challenge that rewards practice and strategic thinking.

### Does Undead Corridor have a multiplayer or co-op mode?

No, Undead Corridor is a strictly single-player experience. The game is focused on the personal challenge of surviving the horde alone and pushing your own limits to achieve a new high score. All progression and unlocks are tied to your individual performance.

### What's the most important tip for a new player?

Master the kick (Spacebar)! It is your single most important survival tool. Use it to push back groups of zombies to give yourself breathing room to reload or switch to a more effective weapon. A well-timed kick is often more valuable than a few extra bullets.
