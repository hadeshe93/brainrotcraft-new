## How to Play Speed Master?

Getting started in Speed Master is as simple as hitting the gas! Your car accelerates automatically, so your entire focus is on steering and survival.

**Controls:**
*   **Keyboard:** Use the 'A' and 'D' keys or the Left and Right Arrow keys to steer your car between lanes.
*   **Mouse:** Click and hold the left mouse button, then drag left or right to guide your vehicle.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your goal is to drive as far as possible. The road is packed with other cars that act as moving obstacles, and you'll also encounter stationary barriers and traps. A single collision will end your run, so sharp reflexes are key. As you drive, be sure to snatch up the glowing coins scattered across the lanes. These coins are your currency for building an epic car collection.

**Progression & The Garage:**
After each run, you can visit the garage. Use the coins you've collected to purchase brand-new vehicles. While some cars are just for looks, others may offer slight advantages in speed or handling, giving you a new feel on the road. Unlocking the entire fleet is a primary goal for dedicated players.

**Beginner's Tip:** Don't just watch your car; keep your eyes focused further down the road to anticipate traffic and obstacles. Sometimes it's smarter to miss a few coins than to risk a crash for them!

## What Makes Speed Master Special?

In a world of complex racing sims, Speed Master stands out for its pure, unadulterated arcade action. Its magic lies in its simplicity. There are no complicated controls to learn or lengthy tutorials to sit through; you're thrown directly into the high-speed chaos from the first click. The game's highly addictive 'one-more-try' loop keeps you coming back, determined to beat your last high score.

What truly sets it apart is the tense, edge-of-your-seat gameplay. It’s not about racing against others to a finish line, but about a personal battle against an ever-faster, ever-more-crowded road. The vibrant neon-noir aesthetic and pumping electronic soundtrack create an immersive, retro-futuristic atmosphere that's both cool and thrilling. Speed Master is the perfect distillation of a racing game: all of the speed, all of the reflexes, and none of the fluff. It’s your skill against the endless road.
