## How to Play Friday Night Funkin vs Whitty?

The goal in FNF vs Whitty is to outperform your opponent by hitting more notes accurately. Use the Arrow Keys or WASD to play. As the songs play, colored arrows will scroll up from the bottom of the screen. When a scrolling arrow perfectly overlaps with its corresponding gray outline at the top, press the matching key. Your accuracy determines your standing, which is visualized by the health bar at the bottom. The bar is split between you (green) and Whitty (red). Hitting notes correctly pushes the bar to your side, while misses or mistakes will push it toward Whitty's. If Whitty's side completely takes over the bar, you lose the round and must try again. The mod features a full 'Week' of songs that get progressively harder. 

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Start Easy:** If you're new, play on Normal or even Easy difficulty to learn the song patterns before tackling Hard.
*   **Focus on the Arrows:** It's tempting to watch the cool animations, but keep your eyes locked on the upcoming arrows to anticipate patterns.
*   **Two-Hand Technique:** For the incredibly fast 'Ballistic' song, try using two hands on the keyboard (e.g., left hand for Left/Up, right hand for Down/Right) to increase your speed and reduce fatigue.
*   **Stay Calm:** The final song is designed to be overwhelming. Don't panic on a miss; just refocus on the next note. Survival is the first step to victory!
