## How to Play Geometry Dash Ocean of Dreams?

The core of Geometry Dash is its simple one-touch control system. You tap the screen, click your mouse, or press the spacebar/up-arrow to make your icon act. The action changes based on your form: as a cube, you jump; as a ship, you fly upwards. Ocean of Dreams utilizes several of these forms. You'll start with the cube, timing your jumps over spikes and blocks. Soon, you’ll enter a ship portal, where holding the button makes you ascend and releasing it makes you fall—mastering gentle taps is key to navigating the narrow passages. The level also features a ball section, where a tap instantly flips your gravity. 

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Use Practice Mode:** This mode allows you to place checkpoints, making it easy to learn tricky sections without starting over.
*   **Feel the Rhythm:** Every obstacle is synced to the music. Listening to the beat can help you anticipate jumps and transitions.
*   **Coin Hunting:** The three secret coins are hidden off the main path. To find them:
    *   **Coin 1 (34%):** In the cube section, drop down through a gap in the floor onto a hidden platform below.
    *   **Coin 2 (65%):** During the ship sequence, fly up through a fake ceiling to find a secret passage above.
    *   **Coin 3 (86%):** In the final ball part, roll off the main path to land on a lower platform where the coin rests.

The obstacles are placed so that, once learned, a player can move through the level in a smooth, uninterrupted, and deeply satisfying way. It’s the perfect 'gateway level'—its low difficulty and high production value provide a fantastic introduction to the creativity of the Geometry Dash community, encouraging new players to explore the millions of other user-made stages available.
