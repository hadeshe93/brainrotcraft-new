## How to Play Shell Shockers?

Jumping into Shell Shockers is easy, but mastering it is a true challenge. You'll start by choosing a class, which determines your primary weapon and stats. Will you be a Scrambler with a powerful shotgun, a Free Ranger with a deadly sniper rifle, or an Eggsploder wielding a rocket launcher? Experiment to find the class that suits your playstyle!

Once in-game, the controls are intuitive for any FPS player:
- **Move:** WASD keys
- **Shoot:** Left Mouse Button
- **Aim Down Sights:** Shift key
- **Jump:** Spacebar
- **Reload:** R key
- **Swap Weapon:** E key
- **Throw Grenade:** Q key

The core gameplay loop involves navigating diverse maps, outmaneuvering opponents, and securing kills across various modes like Free For All, Teams, and the unique 'Captula the Spatula'. As you play, you'll earn Golden Eggs, the in-game currency. Use them in the shop to unlock hundreds of hilarious hats, colorful shells, and cool weapon skins to make your egg stand out. Remember, these are purely cosmetic, so the battlefield is always level.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Stay Mobile:** Never stand still! Jumping and constant movement make you a much harder target.
2.  **Learn the Maps:** Discover high ground, cover spots, and flanking routes.
3.  **Use Your Grenade:** The Q key is your best friend for flushing enemies out of cover or finishing off a cracked foe.
