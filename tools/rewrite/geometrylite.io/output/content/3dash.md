Experience Geometry Dash in a new dimension! Master rhythm-based platforming where the camera twists and turns, adding a dizzying new layer of challenge to the classic dash formula.

## What is 3Dash?

3Dash takes the heart-pounding, rhythm-based action of Geometry Dash and launches it into a mind-bending third dimension. This fan-made masterpiece is a browser-based action platformer that challenges your reflexes and spatial awareness like never before. Your objective remains the same: guide your icon through a gauntlet of geometric obstacles, spikes, and traps, all synchronized to an electrifying soundtrack. However, the fixed 2D plane is gone, replaced by winding 3D paths and a dynamic camera that swoops, spins, and dives with your every move. This creates a disorienting yet thrilling experience designed for veteran Geometry Dash players and anyone craving a supreme test of skill. While it maintains the one-touch control scheme, the added dimension transforms the gameplay, demanding you not only master the timing but also anticipate challenges from constantly shifting perspectives. It's a pure, adrenaline-fueled challenge built for the most dedicated fans of the genre.

## How to Play 3Dash?

Getting started in 3Dash is simple, but mastering it is a monumental task. Your character moves forward automatically, and your only job is to jump at the right moment. Use the **Spacebar, Up Arrow, or Left Mouse Button** to make your icon leap over spikes and pits. The core of the game lies in timing and rhythm. As you progress through a level, you'll encounter various portals that transform your icon and change the controls. For example, the **Ship** form lets you fly by holding the button to ascend and releasing to descend, while the **Ball** form flips gravity with each tap. Pay close attention to interactive objects. Yellow **pads** will bounce you, while blue pads will flip your gravity and bounce you. Orbs, or **rings**, allow you to perform a crucial mid-air jump when you tap inside them. The biggest hurdle is the dynamic 3D camera. It will rotate and change angles, so you must learn to read the level from new perspectives. **Beginner's Tip:** Use Practice Mode! It allows you to place checkpoints, making it infinitely easier to learn the tricky sequences and camera movements without starting over every time. Focus on your icon's path and try to internalize the level's rhythm—the music is your guide.

## What Makes 3Dash Special?

3Dash isn't just Geometry Dash with a new coat of paint; it's a fundamental reimagining of the core gameplay. Its standout feature is the **dynamic 3D camera**. While you still move along a fixed path, the camera swoops, rotates, and twists around you, forcing you to re-evaluate familiar challenges from entirely new angles. This single change transforms the experience from a 2D test of timing into a 3D trial of spatial awareness and nerve. While the original game tests your reflexes, 3Dash tests your ability to maintain focus amidst visual chaos. This makes it a compelling new frontier for veteran players who have mastered the 2D plane and are hungry for a greater challenge. It’s the ultimate fan-made tribute, taking the beloved, punishing formula and asking, 'What if we added another dimension of difficulty?' The result is a visually spectacular and intensely demanding experience that feels both familiar and breathtakingly new.

## Frequently Asked Questions

It can be disorienting and requires you to anticipate obstacles from unfamiliar angles. If you've mastered 2D levels, 3Dash offers a fresh and even more demanding challenge.

### Is 3Dash an official sequel?

No, 3Dash is not an official game developed by RobTop Games. It is a fan-made project created by dedicated members of the Geometry Dash community who wanted to explore what the game would be like in 3D. It stands as a creative tribute to the original, showcasing the passion of its fanbase.

### Where can I play 3Dash?

3Dash is primarily a free-to-play browser game found on various web game portals and creator sites like itch.io. It's built on platforms like WebGL, making it easily accessible on desktop computers with a modern web browser. There are no official mobile or Steam versions of these fan projects.

### What's the best tip for a new player?

Use Practice Mode extensively. The 3D camera angles and level layouts are unforgiving. Practice Mode lets you place checkpoints, so you can learn difficult sections piece by piece without the frustration of starting over. Also, try to focus your eyes on your icon rather than the spinning background to reduce disorientation.
