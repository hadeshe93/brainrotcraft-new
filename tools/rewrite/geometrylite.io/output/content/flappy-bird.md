Test your reflexes in the legendary one-tap challenge! Guide your bird through an endless maze of pipes and see how long you can survive the addictive frustration.

## What is Flappy Bird?

Welcome back to the phenomenon that took the world by storm! Flappy Bird is a deceptively simple, 2D side-scrolling arcade game that tests your patience and precision. Originally a mobile sensation, this classic is now available to play for free in your web browser on PC or mobile. The concept is pure and straightforward: you control a small bird, and your one and only objective is to navigate it through a series of green pipes without crashing. Each tap on the screen gives your bird a little flap, lifting it against the constant pull of gravity. It’s a game that’s easy to learn but brutally difficult to master, making it perfect for players of all ages who love a quick, high-stakes challenge. Prepare for a cycle of 'just one more try' as you chase that elusive new high score.

## How to Play Flappy Bird?

Mastering Flappy Bird is all about rhythm and precision. Your goal is to fly as far as possible without hitting the ground or the iconic green pipes.

**Controls:**
The game uses a simple one-button control scheme.
- **On PC:** Click your left mouse button or press the Spacebar to make the bird flap its wings.
- **On Mobile:** Tap anywhere on the screen.

**Game Mechanics:**
Each tap provides a short upward burst. Without tapping, gravity will pull your bird towards the ground. You must find the perfect tapping rhythm to maintain a steady altitude and navigate through the gaps in the pipes. If you touch a pipe or the ground, the game is over instantly, and your score resets to zero.

**Progression & Scoring:**
Progression is measured by your score. You earn one point for every set of pipes you successfully pass through. There are no levels or stages to unlock; the game is an endless pursuit of beating your personal best. As a bonus challenge, you can earn medals for reaching certain score milestones: a bronze medal at 10 points, silver at 20, gold at 30, and the coveted platinum medal at 40 points. 

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Stay Calm:** Panicking leads to frantic, uncontrolled tapping. Take a deep breath.
2.  **Find a Rhythm:** Try to tap at a steady, consistent pace rather than reacting to each pipe.
3.  **Focus on the Bottom Pipe:** Avoiding the ground and clearing the bottom pipe is your biggest challenge. Keep your eyes there.
4.  **Use Small Taps:** Quick, gentle taps give you more control than large, panicked flaps.

## What Makes Flappy Bird Special?

Flappy Bird’s genius lies in its radical simplicity. In a world of complex games, it offers a pure, unfiltered challenge with just one control. There are no power-ups, no upgrades, and no story—it's just you against the game's unforgiving physics. This simplicity makes it instantly accessible, but its high difficulty creates an incredibly compelling loop. 

The 'just one more try' factor is its most famous trait. Games are short, often lasting only a few seconds, and failure is instant. This combination makes you believe your next attempt will be the one, leading to hours of play. It became a cultural phenomenon because of this shared frustration and the bragging rights that came with a high score. Unlike games where you can blame luck, every crash in Flappy Bird feels like your own fault, driving a powerful desire to improve and conquer the challenge.
