## How to Play Head Soccer 2024?

Mastering Head Soccer 2024 is all about simple controls and perfect timing. The goal is to get the ball into your opponent's net while fiercely defending your own.

**Controls:**
*   **Player 1:** Use **W** to jump, **A** and **D** to move left and right. Press **V** for a short-range kick and **B** for a powerful long-range shot.
*   **Player 2:** Use the **Up Arrow** to jump, **Left** and **Right Arrows** to move. Press **K** for a short-range kick and **L** for a powerful long-range shot.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
You’ll need to manage both offense and defense simultaneously. Use your character's giant head to block shots and bounce the ball over your opponent. The game's physics are bouncy and unpredictable, so positioning is key. There's no complex progression system; each match is a self-contained battle for glory. You can play a single match against the AI or challenge a friend using the same keyboard.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Timing is Everything:** Don't just spam the kick button. Wait for the ball to be in the perfect position to launch a powerful, accurate shot.
*   **Master the Jump-Kick:** Jumping and kicking at the peak of your arc can send the ball flying over your opponent's head for a surprise goal.
*   **Play Smart Defense:** Instead of chasing the ball, try to predict your opponent's moves. Position yourself between them and your goal to act as a human wall.
*   **Use Both Kicks:** The short kick (V/K) is great for control, while the long kick (B/L) is your go-to for clearing the ball or taking a long-distance shot.
