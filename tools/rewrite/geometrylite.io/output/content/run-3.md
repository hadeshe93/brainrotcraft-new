Defy gravity in the ultimate space-running challenge! Sprint through 3D tunnels, leap across impossible gaps, and run on the walls to survive the cosmic corridors of Run 3.

## What is Run 3?

Dive into Run 3, a fast-paced action-platformer that pushes the boundaries of the endless runner genre. You play as a small alien navigating a vast network of treacherous tunnels floating in space. Your primary objective is to survive by running and jumping to avoid falling into the void. Available as a free-to-play browser game (HTML5) and on mobile (iOS/Android), Run 3 is perfect for players who crave a true test of skill, reflexes, and spatial awareness. The game features two main modes: Explore Mode, which offers a hand-crafted campaign with a galaxy map to track your progress, and Infinite Mode, an endless challenge for high-score chasers. As you conquer levels, you'll unlock a diverse roster of new characters, each with unique abilities that fundamentally change how you approach the game's complex challenges. It's a game that's easy to start but incredibly difficult to master, making it a favorite for players seeking rewarding, skill-based fun.

## How to Play Run 3?

Mastering the tunnels of Run 3 is all about precise control and understanding the unique gravity mechanic. Use the Left and Right Arrow Keys to move your character side-to-side, and press the Spacebar or Up Arrow Key to jump.

The core mechanic that sets Run 3 apart is gravity manipulation. When you run onto a side wall or the ceiling, the camera will rotate, and that surface becomes your new floor. This is essential for navigating around large holes and finding safe paths. Your journey unfolds across a galaxy map in Explore Mode, where completing levels unlocks new, more difficult stages and pathways. Along the way, you'll find Power Cells, which can be used to unlock special characters and content.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Stay Calm:** Avoid frantic movements. Small, controlled adjustments are more effective than holding down a direction key.
2.  **Use the Walls:** Don't just think about the floor. The walls and ceiling are your best friends for getting around tricky obstacles.
3.  **Master the Jump:** A well-timed jump can carry you across surprisingly large gaps. Experiment with jumping from different surfaces.
4.  **Switch Characters:** If you're stuck on a level, try using a different unlocked character. The Bunny's high jump or the Skater's speed might be exactly what you need.

## What Makes Run 3 Special?

Run 3 stands out from other runners with its brilliant blend of simplicity and depth. Its signature feature is the 3D gravity-flipping mechanic, which transforms each level from a flat track into a complex spatial puzzle that demands you think in three dimensions. Unlike many procedurally generated runners, Run 3 features a massive, hand-crafted 'Explore Mode' with a branching map, giving players a tangible sense of progression and discovery. The game also boasts a huge roster of unlockable characters—from the speedy Skater to the high-jumping Bunny—each offering distinct abilities that provide strategic solutions to different levels. This adds a layer of replayability and strategy rarely seen in the genre. It’s this combination of unique mechanics, thoughtful level design, and a notoriously high (but fair) difficulty curve that has made Run 3 a beloved classic for players who want to truly master a game.
