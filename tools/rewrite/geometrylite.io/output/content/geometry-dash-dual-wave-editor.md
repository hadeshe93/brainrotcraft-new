Think you've mastered the wave? Try controlling two at once! Design and survive brutally difficult mirrored courses in this fan-made challenge for true Geometry Dash veterans.

## What is Geometry Dash: Dual Wave Editor?

Dive into Geometry Dash: Dual Wave Editor, a challenging fan-made spin-off created by Kokim for the ultimate test of skill. This web-based game isolates and expands upon one of the toughest mechanics from the original series: the dual wave. Your mission is to become both architect and survivor. You'll use a powerful, intuitive editor to design intricate levels filled with obstacles, and then immediately test your creation by attempting to navigate it. The core challenge lies in simultaneously controlling two mirrored waves—one at the top of the screen and one at the bottom. Every click sends both soaring, and every release sends them diving. This game is built for the Geometry Dash veteran who craves a new layer of difficulty and the creative mind eager to design perfectly symmetrical (or devilishly asymmetrical) gauntlets. If you live for the wave game mode and want to push your precision and multitasking skills to their absolute limit, this editor is your new playground.

## How to Play Geometry Dash: Dual Wave Editor?

Mastering the Dual Wave Editor is a two-part challenge: building and surviving. First, enter the **Editor Mode**. Here, you have a simple drag-and-drop interface. Select objects like blocks to create pathways, or deadly saws to serve as hazards. The key to crafting a compelling level lies in the **portals**. Place speed portals to instantly change the tempo for both waves, cranking up the intensity or providing a moment of calm. Once you're ready, switch to **Play Mode** to face your creation. The controls are deceptively simple: **hold the left mouse button or tap and hold the screen to make both waves fly upward** towards the center. **Release the button/tap to let them fall downward** towards the edges. The trick is that your inputs control both waves simultaneously in a mirrored fashion. There's no formal progression system; this is a pure sandbox. Your goal is to build something you can (eventually) beat.

**Beginner Tips:**

- Start by building symmetrical patterns to get a feel for the mirrored controls.
- Use the slowest speed portal to practice navigating tight corridors.
- Build your level in small sections and test them repeatedly to avoid creating impossible traps.
- Remember, the negative space is just as important as the blocks you place!

## What Makes Geometry Dash: Dual Wave Editor Special?

What sets Geometry Dash: Dual Wave Editor apart is its laser focus on a single, notoriously difficult mechanic. While the official game features dual mode as one of many challenges, this spin-off elevates it into an art form. It's a dedicated sandbox for mastering mirrored flight, offering a depth you won't find anywhere else. The true magic lies in the seamless loop between creation and execution. You can place a single block, switch to play mode in an instant to see how it feels, and then switch back to tweak it. This rapid iteration process is a level designer's dream, allowing for the creation of perfectly tuned, rhythm-based puzzles. Unlike the full game, its browser-based nature means zero installation and instant access, making it the perfect tool for quickly sketching out ideas or taking on a quick, intense challenge. It’s a game made by a fan, for the fans who look at the hardest parts of Geometry Dash and say, 'I can make that even harder.'
