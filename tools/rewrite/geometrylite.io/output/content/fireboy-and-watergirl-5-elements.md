## How to Play Fireboy and Watergirl 5 Elements?

Mastering the elements requires coordination and a clear understanding of the rules. Here’s how to get started:

**Controls:**
*   **Watergirl:** Use the **A** and **D** keys to move left and right, and **W** to jump.
*   **Fireboy:** Use the **Left** and **Right Arrow Keys** to move, and the **Up Arrow Key** to jump.

**Core Mechanics:**
Your two heroes have opposing strengths and weaknesses. Fireboy can walk through lava pools but will be extinguished by water. Watergirl can wade through water but will evaporate in lava. A crucial rule: both characters must avoid the dangerous green acid pools! Throughout each level, you'll find red gems for Fireboy and blue gems for Watergirl. You must help them reach their designated doors to finish.

**Progression & Puzzles:**
The game is divided into different elemental temples (Fire, Water, Wind, etc.). To clear a level, you must solve puzzles involving levers, buttons, and platforms. Often, one character will need to hold a switch or press a button to open a path for the other. Communication is key!

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Think Ahead:** Don't rush! Observe the level layout and plan your moves together.
*   **One At a Time:** It's often best to move one character at a time to solve a specific part of a puzzle.
*   **All for One:** Gray gems can be collected by either character, so grab them with whoever is closer.
