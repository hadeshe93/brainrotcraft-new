Face the legendary Extreme Demon, Yatagarasu! This hell-themed megacollab will push your timing, endurance, and rhythm skills to their absolute breaking point.

## What is Geometry Dash Yatagarasu?

Yatagarasu is not a standalone game, but a legendary user-created level within the world of Geometry Dash. Classified as an Extreme Demon, it represents one of the pinnacle challenges in the rhythm-platformer genre. Created by a massive team of over 20 elite builders (a "megacollab") and verified by the player TrusTa, Yatagarasu is a journey into a fiery, dark dimension inspired by the mythical three-legged crow from Japanese lore. Your objective is simple but monumentally difficult: navigate your icon through more than two minutes of relentless, precisely-timed obstacles without a single mistake. The level's dark red and black aesthetic, coupled with its intense difficulty, established it as a spiritual successor to the iconic level Bloodbath. Designed for the most dedicated and skilled Geometry Dash players, conquering Yatagarasu is a rite of passage and a testament to a player's mastery of the game.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Yatagarasu?

Yatagarasu uses the same simple controls as the core Geometry Dash game: a single input (a click, tap, or spacebar press) is all you have. However, the complexity lies in the flawless timing required. This single action makes your icon jump in Cube mode, fly upwards in Ship/UFO mode, flip gravity in Ball mode, and perform short hops in Robot mode. 

Yatagarasu is a marathon of mechanics. You will be tested on every game mode, often with lightning-fast transitions between them. Expect razor-thin gaps for your ship, unforgiving straight-fly sections, and mind-bending wave corridors. The level is famous for its varied gameplay, from the infamous triple-spike jumps in Michigun's part to the chaotic, fast-paced final section. 

Progression is entirely self-driven and requires extreme patience. There is no beating this level without Practice Mode. Here are some essential tips for aspiring conquerors:

1.  **Use Practice Mode:** This is non-negotiable. Learn the entire level's layout and internalize the click patterns for each section.
2.  **Use Copyables:** Search for a copyable version of the level online. This allows you to place start positions anywhere, so you can practice difficult segments (like the ship parts or the ending) repeatedly until they become muscle memory.
3.  **Section by Section:** Don't try to beat it all at once. Master the level in chunks (e.g., 0-20%, 20-41%, etc.). Once you can consistently clear each section, start linking them together in longer runs. Be prepared for a grind; this level takes most top players tens of thousands of attempts to complete.

## What Makes Geometry Dash Yatagarasu Special?

Yatagarasu's legendary status comes from more than just its difficulty. It's a landmark level that defined an era of Geometry Dash. Its most special feature is its creation as a 'megacollab,' uniting the distinct building styles of dozens of the community's most respected creators into one cohesive, epic journey. This results in incredibly diverse and creative gameplay that constantly keeps you on your toes.

Furthermore, its legacy as a former #1 on the Demonlist cements its place in history. Beating Yatagarasu isn't just clearing a level; it's conquering a piece of the game's heritage. The powerful, dark atmosphere, driven by the perfectly synced track 'Flawless Wings of Yatagarasu' by GLS, creates an unforgettable and intimidating experience. While other levels may now be harder, few can match the historical weight, thematic consistency, and sheer epic scale of Yatagarasu.
