Become a parkour legend in Mr Flip! Time your jumps, perform epic backflips across city rooftops, and stick the perfect landing to conquer every level.

## What is Mr Flip?

Mr Flip is an addictive, physics-based arcade game that puts you in the shoes of a daring freerunner. Developed by the hit-maker Ketchapp, this game challenges you to master the art of the flip. Your mission is to navigate a series of urban environments by jumping and backflipping from one platform to the next. The core objective isn't just to cross the gap, but to do so with style and precision, landing perfectly on your feet every time. Available on web browsers as well as iOS and Android mobile devices, Mr Flip is designed for casual players who love a good challenge. Its 'easy to learn, hard to master' gameplay loop makes it perfect for quick sessions or hours of trying to nail that one impossible jump. The game combines the thrill of parkour with the satisfaction of a perfectly executed stunt, making every successful landing a mini-victory.

## How to Play Mr Flip?

Mastering Mr Flip is all about timing and control. The gameplay is straightforward, but requires precision to perfect. Here’s how you become a flipping pro:

**Basic Controls:**

1.  **Charge Your Jump:** Press and hold your mouse button (or tap and hold on mobile) to make your character crouch. A guideline will appear showing your jump trajectory. The longer you hold, the higher and further you'll jump.
2.  **Leap:** Release the button/your finger to launch into the air.
3.  **Perform a Flip:** Once airborne, press and hold again to tuck your body and start rotating in a backflip.
4.  **Stick the Landing:** Release the hold to stop flipping and straighten your body. The key is to release at the right moment so you land perfectly on your feet in the designated landing zone.

**Gameplay Mechanics & Progression:**
You advance through levels by successfully completing a series of jumps. A single bad landing—on your head, back, or face—means you have to restart the level. The challenge increases as platforms become smaller, further apart, or positioned at tricky heights. As you progress, you'll unlock new levels with different themes and a variety of cool new characters to perform your stunts with.

**Beginner Tips:**

- **Start Simple:** Don't try for a triple flip on your first jump. Get comfortable with the timing of a single, clean flip.
- **Release Early:** It's better to release the flip a little early to give your character time to straighten out before landing.
- **Watch Your Character:** Focus on your character's rotation in the air, not just the approaching platform, to better judge when to stop spinning.

## What Makes Mr Flip Special?

While many games involve flipping, Mr Flip stands out with its seamless blend of parkour momentum and precision physics. Unlike stationary flipping games (like those on a trampoline), Mr Flip's constant forward movement across cityscapes creates a thrilling sense of flow and progression. The game's true magic lies in its incredibly satisfying physics engine. The feeling of perfectly timing a release, watching your character snap straight, and nailing a solid landing is what creates its addictive 'one more try' quality. Developed by Ketchapp, the game features a polished, minimalist art style and smooth animations that keep the focus purely on the gameplay. There are no complex power-ups or confusing mechanics—it's a pure test of your timing and nerve. This simplicity is its greatest strength, making it instantly accessible while offering a high skill ceiling that will keep you coming back to prove your mastery.
