## How to Play LOLBeans.io?

Getting started in LOLBeans.io is incredibly easy! Once you've entered your name, you're thrown into a lobby with other players, and the first round begins. The goal is to qualify by reaching the finish line before the player count fills up or by surviving until the timer ends.

**Controls:**
- **Move:** Use the WASD or Arrow Keys to run around.
- **Jump:** Press the Spacebar to leap over gaps and obstacles.
- **Look:** Move your mouse to control the camera and see what's ahead.

**Gameplay Loop:**
The game consists of multiple elimination rounds. In race levels, you must navigate treacherous paths filled with swinging hammers, bouncing balls, and slippery floors to qualify. In survival levels, the goal is simply to stay on the platform and avoid hazards until the timer runs out, eliminating the unlucky few. The final round is an intense race to a single crown. Only the first bean to touch it wins the entire game!

**Beginner Tips:**
- **Patience is a Virtue:** Rushing blindly often leads to getting knocked off. Sometimes it's smarter to wait for an obstacle's cycle.
- **Avoid the Mob:** Big crowds can push you around unpredictably. Try to find a clearer path on the edges of the course.
- **Master the Ledge Jump:** Jumping just as you run off a ledge gives you a slight forward boost. Experiment with your timing to master tricky gaps.

## What Makes LOLBeans.io Special?

While LOLBeans.io might remind you of other party platformers, it carves out its own identity with a focus on pure accessibility and speed.

The gameplay is streamlined for maximum fun. Rounds are lightning-fast, and if you get eliminated, you're back in a new match in seconds, eliminating frustrating wait times. The simple controls (just move and jump) lower the barrier to entry, ensuring that anyone can join in and have a chance to win. What truly makes players love LOLBeans.io is the hilarious, unpredictable chaos. The wonky physics and the sheer number of players bumping into each other mean that no two rounds are ever the same. It's less about perfect execution and more about surviving the pandemonium, leading to endless laughter and memorable moments.
