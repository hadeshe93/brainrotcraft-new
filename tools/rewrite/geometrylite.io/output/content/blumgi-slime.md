To make your slime jump, just **click and hold your mouse button or tap and hold on your screen**. You'll see a power meter build up over your slime—the longer you hold, the more powerful your jump will be. **Release the button or lift your finger to launch your slime** into the air! The key is to master the timing and power of each jump to land precisely where you want.

**Beginner's Tips to Get Bouncing:**
*   **Test the Waters:** On your first few tries, make small, short jumps to understand how the slime's physics feel.
*   **Look Before You Leap:** Take a moment to analyze the level. Plan your path to the finish line before you make your first jump.
*   **Precision is Key:** A massive, full-power jump isn't always the answer. Often, a small, carefully aimed hop is all you need to get to the next platform.
*   **Use Your Surroundings:** Don't be afraid to bounce off walls or use slopes to guide your slime to its destination.
