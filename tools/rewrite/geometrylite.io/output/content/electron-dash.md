## How to Play Electron Dash?

Getting started in Electron Dash is easy, but mastery is a true challenge. You are always moving forward automatically; your job is to navigate the dangers that appear with split-second timing.

**Controls:**
*   **Move Left/Right:** Use the **A/D keys** or the **Left/Right Arrow keys** to strafe along the interior surfaces of the tunnel.
*   **Jump:** Press the **W key**, **Up Arrow key**, or the **Spacebar** to leap over obstacles and gaps.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
The core of the game is avoidance. The tunnel will spin and twist, changing your orientation and forcing you to adapt on the fly. You'll encounter a variety of lethal traps:
*   **Laser Beams:** Brightly colored lines of energy. Some are stationary, others move. Do not touch them!
*   **Unstable Tiles:** These platforms, often glowing red, will disappear shortly after you step on them. Move across them quickly or avoid them entirely.
*   **Gaps:** Large holes in the tunnel. A well-timed jump is your only way to cross.

**Tips for Beginners:**
1.  **Look Ahead:** Don't stare at your character. Keep your eyes focused further down the tunnel to anticipate upcoming obstacle patterns.
2.  **Control Your Jumps:** A short tap is often all you need. Holding the jump key can send you too high, making it hard to land safely.
3.  **Use the Whole Tunnel:** There is no "up" or "down." Use the walls and ceiling to find the safest path as the tunnel rotates.
4.  **Stay Calm:** The increasing speed is designed to make you panic. Breathe, focus on the patterns, and trust your reflexes.

## What Makes Electron Dash Special?

While there are many endless runners, Electron Dash carves out its own identity with a unique blend of style and substance. Its most striking feature is the immersive, retro-futuristic atmosphere. The glowing neon grid, stark blackness of space, and a driving electronic soundtrack work together to create a hypnotic, Tron-like experience that pulls you into the zone.

Unlike many runners that are limited to simple lane-switching, Electron Dash gives you full 360-degree freedom inside the tunnel. The constant rotation of the environment means you're not just dodging left and right; you're thinking three-dimensionally, running on walls and ceilings as if they were the floor. The addition of a jump mechanic adds another critical layer of skill, demanding precise timing to clear gaps and low-profile lasers. It’s this combination of 3D-axis movement, jumping, and a killer aesthetic that makes Electron Dash a pure, addictive, and unforgettable test of skill.
