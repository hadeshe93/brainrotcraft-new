Leap across a chaotic highway of speeding trucks in a first-person test of pure agility and nerve. One wrong move, and it's all over. Can you master the rush and reach the goal?

## What is Cluster Rush?

Cluster Rush is an adrenaline-fueled, first-person 3D platformer that throws you onto the roofs of a massive, unpredictable convoy of speeding trucks. Your one and only goal is to survive by jumping from truck to truck to reach the finish line. As a fast-paced, physics-based game, it strips away distractions, focusing purely on momentum, timing, and pinpoint precision. Developed by Landfall Games, Cluster Rush is the free, web-based prototype that inspired the popular commercial game, *Clustertruck*. It’s designed for players who crave high-difficulty challenges and love entering a 'flow state' where every split-second decision matters. With its minimalist art style, the focus remains squarely on the action, making it an intensely addictive experience. Prepare for a test of reflexes that is easy to learn but incredibly difficult to master. Can you conquer all 35 levels of trucking chaos?

## How to Play Cluster Rush?

Mastering Cluster Rush is all about momentum and precision. The controls are deceptively simple, but the physics-based gameplay provides incredible depth.

**Core Controls:**
- **Move Left/Right:** Use the `A`/`D` keys or the `Left`/`Right` Arrow keys to strafe while on a truck or in mid-air.
- **Jump:** Press the `Spacebar` to leap. The length of your jump is affected by your current momentum, so a running start is crucial.

**Key Mechanics:**
- **Momentum is Everything:** Your speed is your greatest asset. Maintain forward momentum by chaining jumps and landing smoothly. Stopping or hesitating is a sure way to get left behind.
- **Grabbing Ledges:** If you jump towards the side of a truck, you will automatically grab onto the edge, allowing you to hang on for a moment. Use this to save yourself from a bad jump or to line up your next move.
- **Look Ahead:** Don't just focus on the next truck. Scan the road ahead to plan a route two or three trucks in advance. The convoy is chaotic, with trucks swerving, braking, and crashing.

**Progression & Tips for Beginners:**
Cluster Rush features 35 official levels that progressively increase in difficulty. Early levels teach you the basics, but later stages introduce insane jumps, explosive hazards, and wildly unpredictable truck patterns.
- **Tip 1:** Use air-strafing (moving left and right in mid-air) to correct your trajectory and land precisely.
- **Tip 2:** Sometimes, jumping to the side of a truck to grab it is safer than trying to land on top.
- **Tip 3:** Don't be afraid to fail! Repetition is key to learning level layouts and mastering your timing.

## What Makes Cluster Rush Special?

What makes Cluster Rush so addictive is its purity. It’s a raw, unfiltered test of skill. Unlike other platformers, there are no power-ups or complex abilities to manage—it's just you, your jump, and an endless stream of trucks. This focus on core mechanics creates an intense 'flow state' where you're completely absorbed in the action.

The game's physics engine is the star. Every jump feels consequential, and mastering your momentum to chain together a perfect run is incredibly satisfying. The first-person perspective puts you right in the heart of the chaos, making every near-miss and successful landing feel exhilarating. Furthermore, Cluster Rush holds a special place in gaming history as the viral prototype for the hit game *Clustertruck*. It offers players a chance to experience the core concept for free, delivering a high-skill, endlessly replayable challenge that has captivated millions of players with its simple premise and punishing-yet-fair difficulty.
