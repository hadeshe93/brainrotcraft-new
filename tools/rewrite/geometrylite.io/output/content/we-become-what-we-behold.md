Wield the power of the media in a 5-minute game that reveals how your focus shapes society. Capture moments, create headlines, and watch the world react to the news you create.

## What is We Become What We Behold?

We Become What We Behold is a short, thought-provoking narrative game that serves as a powerful commentary on the nature of social media and news cycles. Created by Nicky Case and released in 2016, this free-to-play, browser-based title falls into the point-and-click and interactive art genres. Your main objective isn't to win, but to experience a story. You take on the role of the media, armed with a camera, deciding what moments are “newsworthy” in a world populated by simple circle and square “peeps.” Every photo you take is broadcast to the public, influencing their thoughts and behaviors. This game is perfect for players who appreciate short, impactful experiences and interactive storytelling that encourages critical thinking. It’s a stark and memorable simulation of how focusing on negativity and division can create a self-perpetuating cycle of outrage, all in a compelling 5-minute playthrough.

## How to Play We Become What We Behold?

Getting started is incredibly simple. The game screen is filled with peaceful characters, and your only tool is a camera viewfinder controlled by your mouse.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Move Mouse:** Aims your camera viewfinder around the screen.
- **Left-Click:** “Captures” a moment, taking a picture of whatever is inside the frame.

**Game Mechanics:**
Your goal is to find and capture “newsworthy” events. The game begins with simple prompts, like capturing someone with a hat. Once you click, the photo appears on the central TV screen for all the peeps to see. They will then react to what you’ve shown them. If you capture a moment of minor annoyance, others may become angry or fearful. This reaction then creates new, more dramatic events for you to capture. The game subtly guides you with audio cues or unique character animations, hinting at what you should focus on next to advance the story.

**Progression & Tips:**
Progression is linear; you are guided through a short narrative that escalates with each photo. The game lasts only about 5 to 10 minutes.
- **Listen for Cues:** Pay attention to sounds like a camera shutter or a unique noise that signals a key moment is happening.
- **Follow the Outlier:** If one character is doing something different from the rest, that’s your cue. Your job is to amplify that difference.
- **Embrace the Narrative:** Don’t try to find a “good” ending. The game’s power comes from seeing the inevitable conclusion of the media cycle you are fueling. Just play, observe, and reflect on the outcome.
