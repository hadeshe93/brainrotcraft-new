Leap through rhythm-based challenges in this fast-paced Geometry Dash-inspired platformer. Master official levels, then unleash your creativity and build your own impossible courses in the powerful level editor!

## What is Trigonometry Dash?

Trigonometry Dash is a free-to-play, browser-based rhythm-action platformer created by developer maji. Heavily inspired by the iconic Geometry Dash, it challenges you to navigate a geometric icon through obstacle-filled levels synchronized to electrifying music. Your goal is simple: survive until the end. The gameplay demands razor-sharp reflexes, precise timing, and pattern memorization as you jump, fly, and weave through a relentless barrage of spikes and barriers with a single button. This game is perfect for fans of brutally challenging platformers, rhythm game enthusiasts, and creative players looking for an outlet. While its name is a clever play on its inspiration, you won't need a calculator—just incredible focus and a feel for the beat. Its instant accessibility in a web browser means anyone can jump in and test their skills without any downloads.

## How to Play Trigonometry Dash?

Your character moves forward automatically, so your only job is to react to the obstacles in your path. The controls are simple to learn but difficult to master.

**Core Controls:**
- **Action (Jump/Fly Up/Flap):** `W`, `SPACE`, `UP ARROW`, or `Left Mouse Click`
- **Horizontal Movement (Ship/UFO):** `A`/`LEFT` and `D`/`RIGHT` to steer
- **Downward Movement (Wave):** `S` or `DOWN ARROW` to dive diagonally
- **Restart:** `R` to instantly respawn at your last checkpoint
- **Pause:** `ESC` to take a break

**Game Mechanics:**
Your icon transforms as you pass through different portals, changing the controls and physics:
- **Cube:** The default mode. A simple tap makes you jump.
- **Ship:** Hold the action button to fly upward; release to fall with gravity. Requires controlled bursts to navigate tight spaces.
- **Wave:** Hold to move diagonally up; release to move diagonally down. You must create a smooth zigzag pattern to pass through narrow corridors.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Listen to the Music:** Every obstacle is synced to the beat. Internalizing the rhythm will help you anticipate jumps and actions.
2.  **Start with Easy Levels:** Don't jump into the hardest community levels. Search for 'easy' or 'auto' creations to get a feel for the controls.
3.  **Practice in the Editor:** To master a tricky section, recreate it in the level editor. This lets you practice it repeatedly without frustration.

## What Makes Trigonometry Dash Special?

While many games try to replicate the Geometry Dash formula, Trigonometry Dash stands out for one massive reason: its powerful and accessible built-in level editor. This feature transforms the game from a simple platformer into an endless creative sandbox. Players are not just consumers of content; they are the creators. You can design every aspect of a level, from block placement and spike timing to game mode portals and speed changes, then share your masterpiece with the world.

This community-driven approach ensures a virtually infinite supply of new challenges, ranging from relaxing 'auto' levels to nightmarish 'demon' courses that push the limits of human reaction time. Furthermore, its instant browser-based accessibility removes any barriers to entry. There are no downloads or installations required—you can go from discovering the game to creating your first level in minutes. It's this fusion of classic, addictive gameplay with limitless user-generated content that players love.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Trigonometry Dash available on mobile?

Trigonometry Dash is primarily a browser-based game designed for PC. While it might load on a mobile browser, the experience is not optimized for touchscreens. The precision and rapid inputs required are best handled with a physical keyboard or mouse for optimal control and performance.

### How difficult is Trigonometry Dash?

The difficulty is extremely varied. The official levels provide a solid challenge, but the true spectrum comes from user-created stages. You can find everything from 'auto' levels that play themselves to 'demon' levels that demand near-perfect execution. It’s as hard or as easy as you or the community wants it to be.

### Can I play Trigonometry Dash with friends?

Trigonometry Dash is a single-player game and does not feature a direct multiplayer or co-op mode. The social aspect is centered on the community level-sharing system. You can challenge your friends to beat your scores on specific levels or try to conquer the courses they have created and shared.

### What's the best tip for beating a really hard level?

Patience and chunking are your best tools. Instead of trying to beat the whole level at once, focus on mastering the first 10-20% until you can do it consistently. Once you've got that down, move on to the next section. Breaking a daunting level into smaller, manageable parts makes learning it far less intimidating.
