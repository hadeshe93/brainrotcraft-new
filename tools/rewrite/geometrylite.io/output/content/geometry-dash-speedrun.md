Strap in for a legendary high-octane challenge! Speedrun is a blistering fast Extreme Demon level that tests your reflexes with perfectly synced, non-stop action from start to finish.

## What is Geometry Dash Speedrun?

Geometry Dash Speedrun is an iconic, fan-favorite level from the world of Geometry Dash, now available as a standalone web game. Originally created by Kaito and famed for its place on the Demonlist, this level is the ultimate test of skill in the rhythm-based platformer genre. Your objective is simple on paper but brutally difficult in practice: navigate a single geometric icon through a relentless gauntlet of spikes, saws, and other hazards at blinding speed. The entire level is meticulously synchronized to the intense electronic track "The Final Phase," turning every click into a life-or-death dance move. This game is not for the faint of heart; it's designed for veteran players who crave a top-tier challenge and want to test their muscle memory, timing, and composure against one of the community's most respected creations.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Speedrun?

The controls for Geometry Dash Speedrun are deceptively simple, relying on a single input. Use your mouse, the spacebar, or the up arrow key to make your icon jump. Holding the button down during specific sequences will initiate continuous actions, like flying upwards in the ship or UFO modes.

Your cube, ship, wave, and other forms will change automatically as you progress through the level. Each form has unique physics you must master:
- **Cube:** A single tap results in a single jump.
- **Ship/UFO:** Tap or hold to fly upwards, release to descend.
- **Wave:** Tap or hold to move diagonally up, release to move diagonally down.
- **Ball:** Tap to instantly switch gravity.
- **Spider:** Tap to instantly teleport to the floor or ceiling above.

Success is built on muscle memory and rhythm. The key to survival is learning the level's patterns section by section. Don't be afraid to fail hundreds of times; each attempt builds your knowledge. For a true completion, find and collect the three hidden user coins, which require even more precise maneuvers. 

**Pro-Tip:** If a practice mode is available, use it! Place checkpoints to master difficult sections without having to restart from the beginning. Focus on the music—every beat and synth line is a cue for your next move.

## What Makes Geometry Dash Speedrun Special?

What elevates Speedrun from just another hard level to legendary status is its incredible 'flow'. Despite its extreme difficulty, the level is designed so perfectly that, once mastered, playing it feels like an effortless, high-speed dance. Every input flows seamlessly into the next, creating an adrenaline rush that few other levels can match. It’s a comprehensive test of a player's entire skillset, rapidly transitioning between every game mode, forcing you to be a master of all of them at breakneck speeds. It’s not just a wave challenge or a ship challenge; it’s an *everything* challenge. This, combined with its history as a former top-ranked Demon and its iconic, pulse-pounding soundtrack, makes beating Speedrun a true badge of honor for any Geometry Dash player. It represents a peak of creative level design and a monumental challenge to overcome.
