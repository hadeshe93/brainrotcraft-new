## How to Play Pixel Shooter?

Mastering the arena in Pixel Shooter is all about movement, aim, and strategy. You'll navigate the 3D world using standard FPS controls.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Move:** WASD keys
- **Jump:** Spacebar
- **Sprint:** Left Shift
- **Shoot:** Left Mouse Click
- **Aim Down Sights (ADS):** Right Mouse Click
- **Reload:** R key
- **Switch Weapon:** 1, 2, 3 keys or Mouse Wheel

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
You'll spawn into the match with a basic sidearm. Your goal is to explore the map to find more powerful weapons like assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles, which are scattered at various spawn points. Keep an eye out for ammo and health packs to stay in the fight longer. Each match is a fast-paced Free-For-All (FFA) where every other player is an enemy. Points are awarded for each elimination, and the player with the highest score at the end of the round wins.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Stay Mobile:** Never stand still! Constant movement makes you a much harder target.
2.  **Learn the Maps:** Memorize the locations of powerful weapons, health packs, and good vantage points.
3.  **Aim for the Head:** Headshots deal critical damage and will take down opponents much faster.
4.  **Use Cover:** Duck behind blocks and walls to reload or recover from a firefight. Don't expose yourself unnecessarily.

## What Makes Pixel Shooter Special?

Pixel Shooter stands out in a sea of shooters with its brilliant combination of simplicity and depth. Its biggest draw is **Instant Accessibility**; being a browser-based game means you can jump straight into a multiplayer match in seconds, with no installation or powerful PC required. The game's **Voxel Art Style** is another key feature, offering a clean, colorful, and nostalgic aesthetic that runs smoothly on most systems while providing clear visual feedback.
