Hurtle down an infinite, twisting tube at breakneck speeds! Test your reflexes and see how long you can survive this dizzying, high-score challenge that's impossible to put down.

## What is Tube Fall?

Tube Fall is a high-octane, 3D endless runner that puts your reflexes to the ultimate test. In this fast-paced arcade game, you control a ball plummeting through a procedurally generated tunnel filled with treacherous, shifting obstacles. Your one and only objective is to survive for as long as possible by rotating the entire tube to guide your ball through the safe gaps. Available directly in your web browser, Tube Fall is instantly accessible for anyone craving a quick and intense gaming session. It's designed for players who love pure, skill-based challenges and the thrill of chasing a new high score. If you're a fan of reflex-heavy games like Tunnel Rush or Color Tunnel, you'll feel right at home in the chaotic, neon-lit corridors of Tube Fall, where every run is a unique test of endurance and focus.

## How to Play Tube Fall?

Getting started in Tube Fall is simple, but mastering it is a true challenge. Your character—a ball or other unlockable shape—falls forward automatically at an ever-increasing speed. You don't control the ball itself; instead, you control the environment.

**Controls:**
- Use the `A` and `D` keys or the `Left` and `Right Arrow` keys to rotate the tube left and right.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your goal is to rotate the tube to align the gaps in the red obstacles with your falling ball. If you touch any part of an obstacle, your run ends instantly, and your score is recorded. Throughout the tube, you'll find shimmering coins. Collecting these adds to your bank, which you can use in the main menu to unlock a variety of cool new skins for your ball, adding a fun layer of cosmetic progression to the game.

**Beginner Tips:**
- **Look Ahead:** Don't just focus on the immediate barrier. Try to scan two or three obstacles ahead to anticipate the rotations you'll need to make.
- **Smooth is Fast:** Avoid sharp, jerky movements. Gentle, controlled rotations are more precise and prevent you from overcorrecting and crashing into the next wall.
- **Survival Over Coins:** Especially when you're starting, prioritize dodging obstacles over grabbing a risky coin. A longer run will always yield a better score and more coin opportunities overall.

## What Makes Tube Fall Special?

Tube Fall excels at creating a pure, adrenaline-fueled gameplay loop that's incredibly hard to put down. Its standout feature is the core mechanic: you control the world, not the player. This simple twist on the endless runner genre creates a uniquely immersive and sometimes disorienting experience that requires sharp spatial awareness, not just fast reactions. The game induces a 'flow state,' where the hypnotic visuals and pulsing rhythm of dodging obstacles make the world outside fade away. Unlike games with complex stories or mechanics, Tube Fall offers an unadulterated test of skill. Its beauty lies in its simplicity—no-frills graphics, intuitive controls, and one clear goal. This minimalist approach keeps you focused on the action, constantly daring you to have 'just one more run' to beat your personal best and prove your mastery.
