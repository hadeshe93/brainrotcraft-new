Tee off in a realistic 3D mini golf world! Putt your way through hundreds of challenging courses and unleash your creativity by building and sharing your own.

## What is Mini Golf Club?

Mini Golf Club is a captivating 3D mini golf simulator you can play right in your web browser. It masterfully blends relaxing sports gameplay with clever, puzzle-like course design. As a solo player, your mission is simple: sink the ball in the hole using the fewest strokes possible. You'll navigate hundreds of pre-built courses, each packed with unique obstacles like water hazards, towering ramps, mind-bending loops, and tricky slopes. The game's realistic physics engine means every shot requires careful consideration of power and angle, making each successful putt feel like a true accomplishment. While the core experience is a single-player journey to master every hole, a powerful level editor lets you join a creative community by building and sharing your own mind-bending courses. It’s the perfect game for casual players seeking a fun challenge and creative minds who love to design and build.

## How to Play Mini Golf Club?

Getting started in Mini Golf Club is easy, but mastering its physics-based gameplay takes practice. Your goal on every hole is to shoot at or under par—the recommended number of strokes.

**Core Controls:**
*   **Aim & Power:** Click and hold the left mouse button on your ball. A directional arrow and power meter will appear.
*   **Shoot:** Drag your mouse away from the direction you want to shoot to increase power. The further you drag, the harder the shot. Adjust your aim by moving the mouse left or right, then release the button to putt.
*   **Camera Control:** Press the 'C' key to toggle between a dynamic follow-cam and a strategic top-down view. Always use this to scout the hole before your first shot!

**Progression and Customization:**
You'll progress through an enormous library of courses, unlocking new, more complex stages as you complete the previous ones. Keep an eye out for gold coins scattered across the greens. Collect these to spend in the in-game shop on cool new ball skins, trail effects, and other cosmetic items to personalize your game.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Putt with Precision:** Most holes require finesse, not force. Start with low-power shots until you get a feel for the physics.
2.  **Use the Walls:** Don't be afraid to use the course walls for strategic bank shots. Sometimes, the indirect route is the fastest way to the hole.
3.  **Read the Green:** Pay close attention to subtle slopes on the course, as they will affect your ball's path, especially on longer putts.

## What Makes Mini Golf Club Special?

Mini Golf Club stands out from other browser-based golf games with its incredible depth and creativity. The star feature is its powerful and intuitive **Level Editor**. This isn't just an add-on; it’s a full-fledged creative suite that allows you to design, build, and play your very own courses from scratch. You can place dozens of different track pieces, add challenging obstacles like loops and water traps, and decorate your creation to share with the world, offering nearly endless replayability.

Beyond creation, the game is celebrated for its **realistic physics engine**. The ball reacts believably to slopes, surfaces, and impact force, turning each putt into a satisfying skill-based puzzle rather than a simple point-and-click affair. With hundreds of expertly designed official courses to conquer and a constant stream of new community-made levels to explore, Mini Golf Club offers a perfect blend of challenging solo play and boundless creative freedom.
