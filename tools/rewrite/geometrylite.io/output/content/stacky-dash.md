## How to Play Stacky Dash?

Getting started in Stacky Dash is incredibly easy. The entire game is controlled with simple swipes on your screen or arrow keys on a keyboard. Swipe up, down, left, or right, and your character will glide in that direction until they hit a wall or another obstacle. Your goal on each level is to navigate the maze and collect every single colored tile on the floor. As you move over them, the tiles automatically form a growing stack you 'surf' on. Be strategic! You cannot move back over a path where you've already laid down tiles from your stack, adding a fun puzzle element to your route planning. Once you've collected all the tiles, the path to the next level opens up. Swipe towards it to perform the signature 'Stacky Dash'! You'll surf across the gap on your stack of tiles. Aim for the bonus multipliers at the end of the runway to maximize your score and earn more gems. Use these gems in the shop to unlock dozens of cool new characters and unique tile designs to customize your experience.

## What Makes Stacky Dash Special?

Stacky Dash stands out in the crowded hyper-casual market with its perfectly blended gameplay loop. It’s more than just a maze game; it's a test of strategy and timing. The genius lies in the 'swipe-until-you-stop' control scheme, which is easy to grasp but creates complex navigational puzzles where every move counts. The true magic happens at the end of each level: the 'dash'. Unleashing your entire stack of tiles to surf across the void is an incredibly satisfying payoff that never gets old.
