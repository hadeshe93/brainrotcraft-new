## What is REPO - The Original?

Ever wondered what it’s like to be a cosmic repo agent? Welcome to REPO - The Original, a terrifying free-to-play, browser-based horror game that puts you and up to five friends in the hot seat. Your job is simple: drop onto a desolate, pitch-black moon, locate and extract a list of valuable items, and get back to the ship before the unspeakable horrors that lurk in the dark find you. Combining the strategic teamwork of co-op survival with the immersive dread of first-person horror, REPO is a heart-pounding experience designed for players who love high-stakes challenges and shared scares. With its immersive physics and reliance on real-time communication, every mission is an unpredictable descent into chaos. If you enjoy games like Lethal Company but crave a unique twist with a focus on physics-based interaction, you’ve found your next obsession. Are you brave enough to make the quota?

## How to Play REPO - The Original?

Your mission as a repo agent is dangerous, but understanding the tools of the trade will give you a fighting chance. Here’s how to survive your first job.

**Getting Started:** Each round begins on your ship. Approach the main terminal to see your repo list—these are the specific items you must find and extract. Once you land, your goal is to venture into the dark facility, locate those items, and bring them back to the ship's cargo bay.

**Core Controls & Mechanics:** Use **WASD** to move and your **Mouse** to look around. Activate your flashlight with **T**, but be warned—light attracts unwanted attention. Your primary tool is the physics-based grabbing gun. **Left-Click** to pull objects towards you and **Right-Click** to push them away. This is crucial for retrieving loot, clearing paths, and even creating makeshift barriers. Interact with doors and terminals using **E**, and use **Shift** to sprint when you need to make a quick escape, but watch your stamina bar!

**Teamwork is Everything:** You can’t succeed alone. Many valuable items are too heavy for one person and require two players to carry them using their grabbers in tandem. Stick close to your team, as the proximity voice chat means you can only hear and be heard by those nearby. Clear communication is the difference between a successful repo and a team wipe.

## What Makes REPO - The Original Special?

In a sea of co-op horror games, REPO - The Original stands out with its brilliant blend of physics-based chaos and pure accessibility. The star of the show is the **physics-based grabbing tool**. This isn't your standard 'pick-up' mechanic; it's a dynamic gravity gun that lets you pull, push, and manipulate the world around you. This opens the door for creative problem-solving, like building barricades out of debris or working with a teammate to awkwardly haul a giant artifact through a narrow corridor. Unlike other games in the genre, REPO is **instantly accessible**. As a free, browser-based game, you can jump into a session with friends in seconds—no downloads, no cost. This low barrier to entry makes it the perfect game for a spontaneous night of scares. It’s this combination of unique mechanics and easy access that players love, creating unscripted moments of terror and comedy that you’ll be talking about long after the mission is over.
