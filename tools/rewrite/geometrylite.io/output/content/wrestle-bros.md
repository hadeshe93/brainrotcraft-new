## How to Play Wrestle Bros?

Mastering the ring in Wrestle Bros is all about timing and smart moves. Here’s how to get started:

**Controls:**
*   **1-Player Mode:** Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move, jump, and duck. Press Spacebar or G to perform actions.
*   **2-Player Mode:** Player 1 uses WASD + G, while Player 2 uses Arrow Keys + L.

**Core Gameplay Mechanics:**
The key to combat isn't just mashing the action button. Combine your movement keys with the action key to execute different attacks. For example, pressing Up + Action might perform an uppercut or lift, while Forward + Action executes a dropkick. Experiment to discover your character's unique moveset! Each hit you land and take fills your Special Meter at the bottom of the screen. Once it's full and flashing, press your action button to unleash a devastating, character-specific finisher to turn the tide of the match!

**Progression & Tips for Beginners:**
Your goal in single-player is to win the tournament. Each victory progresses you to the next opponent and helps you unlock new characters and arenas.
*   **Start with Defense:** Learn to block (Down key) to reduce damage and look for openings.
*   **Learn Your Combos:** Don't just spam one attack. Mix up punches, kicks, and grabs.
*   **Use the Ropes:** Bounce off the ring ropes to launch surprise aerial attacks.
*   **Save Your Finisher:** Don't waste your special move. Use it when your opponent's health is low to secure the knockout.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I unlock new characters in Wrestle Bros?

You can expand your roster of fighters by playing and winning in the single-player Tournament mode. As you defeat a series of opponents and advance through the brackets, you will automatically unlock new characters to use in all game modes. Keep winning championships to collect them all and discover their unique moves and finishers!

### How does the 2-player mode work?

Wrestle Bros features a fantastic local 2-player mode, allowing you to battle against a friend on the same computer. Player 1 uses the WASD keys for movement and the G key for actions. Player 2 uses the Arrow Keys for movement and the L key for actions. Simply select the 2-player option from the main menu, pick your characters, and get ready to brawl!

### Can I play Wrestle Bros on my mobile phone?

Wrestle Bros is primarily designed as a browser game for desktop computers using a keyboard. While some mobile browsers might be able to run it, the experience is not optimized for touchscreens, and you won't have access to the proper controls. For the best gameplay experience, we recommend playing on a PC or laptop with a keyboard.

### The game feels hard. Any tips for winning?

Absolutely! Don't forget to block by holding the Down key—it's crucial for survival. Instead of just pressing the attack button, combine it with directional keys (Up, Forward) to perform different moves like throws and dropkicks. Try to corner your opponent and use the ropes to your advantage. Finally, save your special finisher move for when their health is low to guarantee a win!
