Master the art of gravity-flipping in Geometry Dash Cycles! Test your reflexes in this iconic level that introduces the challenging ball mode, all synced to an unforgettable beat.

## What is Geometry Dash Cycles?

Geometry Dash Cycles is the 9th official level created by RobTop Games, serving as a pivotal challenge for players. As a rhythm-based action platformer, your main objective is to navigate your icon through a gauntlet of spikes and obstacles, perfectly timed to an electrifying soundtrack. This level is famous for introducing a brand-new game mechanic: the ball mode. Unlike previous levels that focus on jumping and flying, Cycles forces you to master gravity reversal, creating a unique and demanding gameplay experience. It's designed for players who have conquered the earlier stages and are ready for a significant step-up in difficulty. Completing Cycles is a rite of passage, proving you have the rhythm and reflexes to handle the tougher challenges that lie ahead in the world of Geometry Dash.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Cycles?

Your goal in Geometry Dash Cycles is to reach the end of the level by surviving its rhythm-synced obstacles. The controls adapt to your icon's form. As the Cube, a single tap or click makes you jump. As the Ship, you hold to fly upward and release to descend. The main challenge in Cycles is mastering the new Ball form. In this mode, a single tap instantly flips gravity, snapping you between the floor and the ceiling. There is no jump; it's all about timing these gravity shifts to weave through tight corridors and avoid spikes. 

The level progresses through distinct phases, starting with a cube section, then introducing the ball, followed by a short ship sequence, and culminating in more complex and faster ball sections. 

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Use Practice Mode:** Don't be afraid to use checkpoints in Practice Mode. It's essential for learning the patterns, especially in the tricky ball segments.
*   **Listen to the Music:** The track, "Cycles" by DJVI, is your guide. The beat and musical cues often signal exactly when you need to tap.
*   **Master the Ball Early:** Spend time getting a feel for the ball's gravity-flipping mechanic. Unlike the cube's arc, the ball's movement is instant, so your timing needs to be precise.
*   **Stay Calm in Triple-Speed:** The level features sections at 3x speed. The patterns are simple, but the speed is intimidating. Focus on the rhythm and your muscle memory will take over.
