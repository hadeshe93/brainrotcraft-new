Test your patience and precision in Egg Race! Navigate treacherous hills and balance a fragile egg on your car in this maddeningly addictive physics-based driving challenge.

## What is Egg Race?

Egg Race is a captivating 2D physics-based driving game that swaps high-speed thrills for nerve-wracking precision. Available instantly in your web browser, the game presents a simple yet profound challenge: transport an egg resting on your vehicle's roof as far as possible across an endless, bumpy landscape. This isn't a race against opponents, but a test of your own patience and fine motor control. The core objective is to achieve the longest distance without letting the egg fall and smash. Every meter you travel adds to your score and earns you coins. Designed for players who love skill-based challenges and the 'just one more try' gameplay loop, Egg Race is deceptively simple to learn but incredibly difficult to master. It combines the physics of hill-climbing racers with the delicate tension of a balancing act, creating a uniquely stressful and rewarding experience. Can you keep your cool and deliver your fragile cargo safely?

## How to Play Egg Race?

Mastering Egg Race is all about delicate control, not speed. The controls are simple: use the 'W' or 'Up Arrow' key to accelerate forward and the 'S' or 'Down Arrow' key to brake and reverse. On mobile, you typically tap the right side of the screen to go forward and the left side to brake.

The key mechanic is the physics engine. Accelerating quickly will tilt your car backward, threatening to slide the egg off the back. Braking hard will pitch the car forward, sending the egg flying over the hood. Your goal is to use small, controlled 'taps' of the throttle and brake to maintain a steady pace and keep the egg nestled safely on the roof. As you travel, you'll earn coins based on the distance you cover. These coins are crucial for progression, as you can use them in the garage to unlock a variety of new vehicles. Each car, truck, or van has different characteristics—some are more stable, some are faster, and some have unique roof shapes that affect how the egg balances. 

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Slow and Steady:** Forget speed. Your primary goal is survival. Drive slowly and deliberately.
2.  **Feather the Controls:** Tap, don't hold. Gentle, short bursts of acceleration and braking are the key to keeping the egg stable.
3.  **Use Your Car's Tilt:** Anticipate hills. Lean back slightly by accelerating before an incline to 'cradle' the egg as you go up. Use gentle brakes on downhills to prevent it from rolling forward.

## What Makes Egg Race Special?

What makes Egg Race so addictive is its brilliant fusion of simplicity and depth. Unlike other driving games focused on speed and spectacle, its entire premise hinges on one universally understood concept: fragility. The egg is the star, and its precariousness creates a constant, palpable tension that is both frustrating and hilarious. The game's 'one more try' appeal is immense; since runs are often short and restarting is instant, you're constantly tempted to try again to beat your personal best by just a few more meters. This simple high-score chase, powered by a sensitive and consistent physics engine, makes every small success feel like a major achievement. While other games add complex features, Egg Race strips everything back to a pure test of skill. There are no power-ups or shortcuts, only your ability to master the delicate dance between acceleration, braking, and gravity. This purity is what makes finally unlocking a new car and setting a new record so incredibly satisfying.
