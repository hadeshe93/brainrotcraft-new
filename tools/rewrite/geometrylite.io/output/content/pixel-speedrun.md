Welcome to Pixel Speedrun, the ultimate test of precision and speed!

Your mission is simple: guide your white pixel through 30 meticulously crafted levels, dodging deadly red obstacles and navigating complex mazes to reach the safety of the green portal.

The clock is always ticking, pushing you to perfect your route and shave milliseconds off your time. Can you master the mechanics and conquer all 30 levels?

## How to Play Pixel Speedrun?

Getting started in Pixel Speedrun is easy, but mastery takes practice. The game is built on a foundation of pure, responsive controls that reward precision and muscle memory. 

**Core Controls:**
*   **Move:** Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** to move your pixel left and right.
*   **Jump:** Press the **'Z' Key**, **Spacebar**, or **Up Arrow** to jump.

**Key Game Mechanics:**
Your goal is to navigate from the start to the green exit portal in each level. Anything colored red is a hazard—spikes, lava, or walls—and touching it will instantly reset you to the beginning of the level. This instant-restart system is a core feature, encouraging you to experiment and learn through rapid trial and error without frustrating loading screens.

The most crucial skill to master is the **wall jump**. By jumping towards a wall and then pressing the jump key again as you make contact, you can propel yourself upwards and away from it. This technique is essential for clearing large gaps, scaling vertical shafts, and navigating the game's most complex challenges.

**Tips for Beginners:**
1.  **Master the Wall Jump:** Find a safe spot in an early level and practice jumping back and forth between two walls to get a feel for the timing and rhythm.
2.  **Memorize Layouts:** Success in speedrunning comes from muscle memory. Replay levels to memorize the optimal path and timing of your jumps.
3.  **Don't Fear Failure:** You will die. A lot. Embrace the quick respawns as a learning tool, not a punishment. Each attempt refines your path to victory.

## What Makes Pixel Speedrun Special?

In a sea of platformers, Pixel Speedrun stands out for its ruthless dedication to purity and skill. Its magic lies in what it *doesn't* have: no distracting power-ups, no complex story, no unnecessary mechanics. It's a pure, unadulterated test of your platforming prowess.

The minimalist art style is a core part of the experience. The stark contrast between your white pixel, the deadly red hazards, and the green goal provides instant, unambiguous feedback. This clarity allows you to focus entirely on your movement and timing, making every success and failure your own.

What truly makes Pixel Speedrun beloved is its perfectly tuned difficulty curve and the 'just one more try' gameplay loop. The combination of challenging levels, a prominent speedrun timer, and instant, penalty-free respawns creates an addictive cycle of failure and eventual triumph. It’s a game designed from the ground up not just to be beaten, but to be mastered and optimized, making it a perfect playground for aspiring and veteran speedrunners alike.
