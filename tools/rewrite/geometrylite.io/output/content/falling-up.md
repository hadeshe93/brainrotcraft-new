Ascend through a legendary Extreme Demon from creator KrmaL. Master punishing straight-fly and synchronized duals in a breathtaking journey from a neon city to the heavens.

## What is Falling Up?

Falling Up is not a standalone game, but a legendary user-created level within the rhythm-platformer Geometry Dash. Created by the renowned KrmaL, it's an Extreme Demon (10 stars) that represents a monumental challenge for elite players. Your objective is simple: navigate your icon from the start to the end of the level without crashing. The level takes you on a visually stunning journey across distinct environments, starting in a glowing cityscape, descending into a chaotic storm, and finally ascending to a serene, rainbow-filled heaven. Synced to the iconic track "Forsaken Neon" by Dimrain47, every jump and flight is part of an atmospheric experience. This level is designed for veteran Geometry Dash players who have mastered the game's core mechanics and are looking to conquer one of the most famous Extreme Demons in the community's history. It's playable on any platform with Geometry Dash, including PC, macOS, and mobile devices.

## How to Play Falling Up?

Falling Up uses Geometry Dash's simple one-button control scheme: click your mouse or tap the screen to jump and interact. When in the ship gamemode, hold to fly upward and release to descend. The challenge comes from the level's brutal precision and endurance requirements.

**Key Segments & Mechanics:**

- **Neon City (0-27%):** The level begins with a relatively calm cube section requiring precise, timed jumps through a glowing urban landscape. This serves as a warm-up for what's to come.
- **The First Straight-Fly (28-40%):** This is the level's first major gatekeeper. You enter a ship section with an extremely narrow corridor, demanding near-perfect, consistent micro-clicks to maintain a straight flight path. Mastering this part is crucial.
- **The Storm (41-76%):** As the music intensifies, you're thrown into a faster-paced sequence through a dark, rainy environment. This part tests your ability to react to quick transitions between tight ship corridors and cube jumps.
- **Heavenly Duals (77-93%):** The final challenge is a dual section where you control two cube icons simultaneously. The paths are mirrored and require flawless symmetrical clicking to navigate the bright, rainbow-filled finale.

**Tips for Success:**

- Use Practice Mode to learn the layout and timing without starting over on every failure.
- Download a copy of the level (ID: 31278591) to place start positions and drill difficult sections, especially the first straight-fly and the final duals.
- Focus on learning the click patterns rather than just reacting. Consistency is everything.

This visual and musical storytelling creates an unforgettable experience.

Created and verified by a single legendary creator, KrmaL, it stands as a testament to individual skill and creative vision.
