## What is My Perfect Hotel?

Welcome to My Perfect Hotel, where your management skills are put to the ultimate test! This isn't your average idle tycoon game; it's a vibrant, hands-on simulation adventure available on iOS, Android, and web browsers. You start as a lone manager with a humble motel and a dream. Your goal is to transform it into a luxurious 5-star resort by personally attending to every guest's need. From checking guests in and cleaning rooms to collecting payments and expanding your facilities, you'll be on your feet constantly. The game combines the satisfaction of building and upgrading with the frantic fun of a time-management challenge.

## How to Play My Perfect Hotel?

Getting started in My Perfect Hotel is simple, but mastering your hotel takes speed and strategy. You control your manager with a simple on-screen joystick—just drag your finger where you want to go. Your primary job is to keep the cash flowing and guests happy.

The core gameplay loop involves:
1.  **Greeting Guests**: Run to the reception desk to check in new arrivals.
2.  **Room Service**: Escort guests to their rooms. Once they check out, the room needs cleaning. Dash over to make it spotless for the next guest.
3.  **Collecting Cash**: Grab the money left by satisfied customers.
4.  **Upgrading Everything**: Use your earnings to improve your hotel. Tap on upgrade stations to buy more rooms, better beds, vending machines, and eventually even restaurants and pools. You can also upgrade your character's speed and carrying capacity.

As you grow, you'll get overwhelmed. That's when you hire help! Hire cleaners and receptionists to automate tasks, and be sure to upgrade them too so they work faster. The ultimate goal is to fully upgrade your entire hotel, which then unlocks a new, more exotic location for you to build your next masterpiece.

**Beginner's Tip**: Your first priority should be hiring a cleaner. This frees you up to focus on earning money and serving guests, dramatically speeding up your progress.

## What Makes My Perfect Hotel Special?

What sets My Perfect Hotel apart from other tycoon games is its hands-on, active gameplay. Instead of navigating complex menus, you are the action! You physically run your character from task to task, creating a frantic and engaging experience that feels more like an arcade game than a passive simulator. This emphasis on speed and direct control makes every moment count. The visual progression is incredibly satisfying; you'll watch a dusty, forgotten motel transform into a bustling, luxurious resort right before your eyes. The game strikes a perfect balance between simple, intuitive controls and a surprisingly deep upgrade system. While many management games become idle clickers, My Perfect Hotel keeps you on your toes, constantly making decisions and prioritizing tasks in real-time. It’s this blend of action, strategy, and rewarding visual feedback that has players hooked.
