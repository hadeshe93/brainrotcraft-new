Test your reflexes in a pure survival challenge! Tap to guide your cube through an endless, high-speed corridor of geometric hazards and chase the ultimate high score.

## What is Geometry Head?

Geometry Head is an intense, fan-made arcade game that strips the Geometry Dash experience down to its most addictive core: pure, unfiltered survival. As a hyper-casual endless runner, it challenges you to navigate a single cube through a deadly, ever-narrowing corridor. Played directly in your web browser, your sole objective is to survive for as long as possible by avoiding a relentless, randomly generated stream of spikes and blocks. The game is designed for players who crave a straightforward yet demanding test of skill. As you progress, the speed increases exponentially, turning a simple reflex game into a hardcore challenge. If you love chasing high scores and thrive under pressure, Geometry Head offers an instantly accessible and infinitely replayable experience that will push your reaction time to its absolute limit.

## How to Play Geometry Head?

Mastering Geometry Head is all about precision and timing. Your goal is to guide the cube as far as possible without crashing into any of the geometric obstacles that appear from the top and bottom of the screen.

**Controls:**
The controls are deceptively simple. A single action moves your cube.
*   **PC:** Click your mouse or press the Spacebar.
*   **Mobile:** Tap anywhere on the screen.

Each tap instantly switches your cube's vertical lane, moving it from the top path to the bottom path, or vice-versa. There's no jumping or flying; it's a direct lane switch to dodge the opposing hazards.

**Gameplay & Progression:**
You begin at a manageable speed, but don't get comfortable. The game's primary challenge is its constantly accelerating pace. The farther you travel, the faster you go, demanding quicker reactions and better predictive skills. Your score is measured in the distance you survive. One collision with an obstacle means an instant game over, but a quick restart button gets you right back into the action.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Focus on the Center:** Keep your eyes fixed on the middle of the screen. This gives you the best view of upcoming obstacles from both lanes.
*   **Anticipate, Don't React:** Try to look ahead and plan your taps instead of just reacting to the closest threat.
*   **Stay Calm:** Panic-tapping will lead to mistakes. Make deliberate, controlled movements to stay in rhythm as the speed ramps up.

## What Makes Geometry Head Special?

While inspired by Geometry Dash, Geometry Head carves its own identity by focusing on a single, perfected mechanic. It trades complex, level-based platforming for an endless, high-speed gauntlet of pure reflex. This minimalist approach is its greatest strength—there are no power-ups, no different vehicles, and no breaks. It's just you, your cube, and an infinite corridor of chaos.

What makes it so addictive is the combination of randomly generated patterns and a brutally steep difficulty curve. No two runs are ever the same, ensuring limitless replayability. The game is perfectly engineered for that 'one more try' feeling, as instant restarts and the tantalizing possibility of beating your personal best keep you hooked. Players love it because it’s a pure, undiluted test of skill. Success isn't about memorizing levels; it's about raw reaction time and mental endurance, making every new high score feel like a true achievement.
