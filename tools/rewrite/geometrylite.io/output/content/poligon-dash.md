Think you've mastered Geometry Dash? Try going vertical! Poligon Dash flips the script with intense, top-down arcade action that will test your reflexes like never before.

## What is Poligon Dash?

Poligon Dash is an electrifying, fan-made spin on the iconic rhythm-platformer, Geometry Dash. Instead of the classic side-scrolling action, this game turns the world on its head, challenging you with a relentless vertical ascent. As a fast-paced arcade game playable directly in your web browser, Poligon Dash is designed for players who crave a true test of skill. Your main objective is to guide your geometric avatar upwards through an ever-accelerating gauntlet of spikes, moving blocks, and other deadly hazards. Every level demands razor-sharp focus and split-second reactions. Whether you're a seasoned Geometry Dash veteran looking for a fresh challenge or a newcomer who loves high-stakes arcade action, Poligon Dash offers an addictive and punishingly fun experience that will keep you coming back for 'just one more try'.

## How to Play Poligon Dash?

Getting started in Poligon Dash is simple, but mastering it is a true challenge. Your polygon automatically moves upward, and your only job is to steer it left and right to avoid a deadly maze of obstacles.

**Controls:**
*   **PC/Mac:** Use the `A` and `D` keys or the `Left` and `Right Arrow` keys to move your character.

The core mechanic is survival. One touch against a spike or block, and you're sent back to the start of the level. The speed gradually increases as you ascend, demanding faster reactions and more precise control. Progression in Poligon Dash is all about persistence. Beating levels and reaching high scores will often reward you with new skins, allowing you to customize your polygon and show off your achievements.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Stay Centered:** Try to return to the center of the path after dodging an obstacle to give yourself more room to react to the next one.
*   **Look Ahead:** Don't just focus on your character. Scan the top of the screen to anticipate upcoming patterns and plan your route in advance.
*   **Learn the Patterns:** Each level is a fixed puzzle. Don't be discouraged by failing; use each attempt to memorize the layout and conquer tricky sections through repetition.
*   **Small Taps:** Use short, controlled taps on the keys instead of holding them down to avoid over-steering into danger.
