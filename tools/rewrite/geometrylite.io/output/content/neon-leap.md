Leap through a dazzling neon world where timing is everything. Master the rhythm of the swing and climb an endless tower of light in this addictive arcade challenge!

## What is Neon Leap?

Neon Leap is a captivating, skill-based arcade game that tests your rhythm and precision. As a glowing avatar, your goal is to ascend an endless tower of geometric platforms set against a stark, dark void. This browser-based game falls into the endless climber and one-button/two-button genre, where the primary objective is to achieve the highest score possible by successfully landing on platform after platform. The game's minimalist neon aesthetic and hypnotic physics create an immersive atmosphere that appeals to players who love high-score chasers, minimalist design, and purely skill-focused challenges. Each jump is a high-stakes decision; a single miscalculation sends you plummeting back to the start, fueling that 'one more try' desire to beat your personal best.

## How to Play Neon Leap?

The beauty of Neon Leap lies in its simple controls and deep mechanics. Your character swings automatically from a central pivot point on each platform. Your only job is to time the release perfectly to jump to the next level.

**Controls:**

- **A / Left Arrow:** Press to leap left from your swing.
- **D / Right Arrow:** Press to leap right from your swing.

The core gameplay loop is about observing your arc and pressing the jump key at the exact moment to land on the next platform. As you climb higher, the challenge evolves with smaller platforms, moving platforms, and trickier placements that demand greater foresight and precision. Your score is simply the number of platforms you've successfully landed on. There are no power-ups or complicated systems—progression is measured by your own improving skill and rising high score.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Feel the Rhythm:** Don't rush your jumps. Watch a few swings to understand your arc and momentum before you leap.
2.  **Aim for the Center:** Landing in the middle of a platform provides the most stable base for your next swing.
3.  **Watch Movers:** For moving platforms, anticipate their path. It's often best to jump as the platform is moving toward your ideal landing spot.

## What Makes Neon Leap Special?

While many games involve jumping, Neon Leap stands out with its unique core mechanic: the constant, automatic swing. Unlike typical platformers where you have direct control over your character's movement, here you only control the release. This transforms the game into a physics-based puzzle of timing and trajectory, making each successful jump feel incredibly rewarding. This focus on pure skill is another key differentiator. With no power-ups or external advantages, your success is a direct reflection of your mastery over the game's rhythm. The minimalist neon-on-black aesthetic, combined with the smooth swinging motion, creates a hypnotic, almost trance-like experience. This, along with the quick-restart nature of the game, generates an intense 'one more try' compulsion that keeps players hooked for hours as they chase that next high score.
