Herd your way to victory in this chaotic physics-based battle royale! Charge, ram, and knock rival sheep off stunning arenas to become the last one standing.

## What is Crazy Cattle 3D?

Welcome to the hilarious, chaotic world of Crazy Cattle 3D! Despite the name, you're not a cow—you're a numbered sheep with an attitude. This game is a physics-based, .io-style battle royale where you compete against other players in real-time. Played directly in your web browser on PC or mobile, it throws you into stunningly beautiful arenas inspired by real-world locations like Iceland and New Zealand. Your mission is simple but frantic: be the last sheep standing. You’ll achieve this by charging into your woolly opponents and sending them flying off cliffs, into volcanic geysers, or down treacherous pits. As you eliminate rivals, your own number—and power—grows, making you a greater force on the battlefield. Crazy Cattle 3D is perfect for anyone seeking quick bursts of competitive fun, from casual players looking for a laugh to seasoned .io game veterans who love action.

## How to Play Crazy Cattle 3D?

Jumping into Crazy Cattle 3D is easy, but mastering the pasture takes skill. The controls are incredibly simple: use your mouse to play. Click and hold the left mouse button to start aiming your charge. A targeting arrow will appear, showing the direction of your dash. The longer you hold the button, the more powerful your charge becomes, so time it wisely! Release the button to launch your sheep forward. The core mechanic is all about physics. Your goal is to ram into other sheep with enough force to send them over the edge of the arena. When you successfully knock an opponent out, their number is added to yours, increasing your size and mass. A higher number means you hit harder and are more difficult to push around. As you progress through a match, the arena may shrink or change, adding to the pressure.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Aim Before You Charge:** Don't just charge blindly; aim for the best angle to push opponents toward an edge.
*   **Use the Environment:** Lure enemies near cliffs or use hazards like geysers for a surprise takedown.
*   **Pick Your Fights:** Target sheep with lower numbers first to build your power safely.
*   **Mind Your Position:** Staying near the center of the map is much safer than lingering by the perilous cliffs!
