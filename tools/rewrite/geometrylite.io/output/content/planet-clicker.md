Click your way from a barren rock to a thriving civilization! Generate energy, build powerful upgrades, and watch your world grow in this addictive idle game.

## What is Planet Clicker?

Welcome to Planet Clicker, the captivating idle game where you hold the power to create a world. Originally developed by Coltroc on the Scratch platform, this browser-based gem has become a favorite for its simple yet deeply satisfying gameplay. You begin with nothing but a single, empty planet. Your mission is to click it to generate energy, the core resource for all development. As you accumulate energy, you'll invest in a series of upgrades that transform your barren rock into a bustling civilization, complete with farms, factories, and advanced power plants. Planet Clicker is perfect for players of all ages who enjoy incremental progress and the thrill of watching numbers climb. Whether you have a few minutes to click or want to let the game run in the background, your journey from a simple click to a self-sustaining world awaits.

## How to Play Planet Clicker?

Getting started in Planet Clicker is as simple as a single click! Your primary control is your mouse. Click the large planet in the center of your screen to generate your first units of energy. This energy is your currency for growth. On the right, you'll see a list of available upgrades, starting with the 'Earth Clicker' and 'Campfire'. The 'Earth Clicker' increases the amount of energy you gain per click, making your manual efforts more effective. All other upgrades, like the Farm and Windmill, provide passive income, automatically generating a steady stream of 'Energy Per Second' (EPS) even when you're not clicking. Your progression is a strategic balance: do you buy more of a cheap upgrade or save up for a more expensive, efficient one? A great beginner's tip is to invest in a few 'Earth Clicker' levels initially, then immediately start building your passive income with Campfires and Farms. These automatic generators are the key to unlocking massive growth. Let the game idle in another tab and come back to a mountain of energy ready to be invested in your planet's future!

## What Makes Planet Clicker Special?

While there are many clicker games, Planet Clicker stands out for its elegant simplicity and immensely satisfying progression loop. Unlike more complex idle games that can be overwhelming, its straightforward 'tech tree' provides a clear and achievable path from a barren rock to a high-tech world. This visual and thematic journey—from a simple campfire to a fusion power plant—is far more compelling than just watching a number go up. The game perfectly balances the reward of active clicking with the power of idle generation. You can feel your impact with every click, but the real magic happens when your automated planetary engine takes over, earning vast amounts of energy while you're away. It’s this pure, distilled sense of growth and accomplishment that makes Planet Clicker a timeless classic in the genre.
