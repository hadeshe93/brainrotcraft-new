Blast your way through puzzle-filled levels where your only way to move is your weapon's recoil. Aim, shoot, and fly to eradicate a viral threat in this unique physics-based platformer!

## What is Recoil?

Recoil is a brilliant and addictive physics-based puzzle-platformer created by acclaimed indie developer Martin Magni (creator of Fancade). The game flips traditional platforming on its head: you have no buttons for walking or jumping. Your sole method of movement is the powerful recoil from your handgun. Your mission is to navigate a series of minimalist, self-contained levels and eliminate all the hostile pink viruses. By aiming and firing your weapon, you propel your character in the opposite direction, turning every movement into a calculated risk. It’s a game that’s incredibly easy to learn but offers a surprising amount of depth and challenge. Recoil is perfect for players who love clever mechanics, brain-teasing puzzles, and games that reward precision and strategic thinking. It's primarily available as a free-to-play web browser game, making it instantly accessible to anyone looking for a quick and clever gaming session.

## How to Play Recoil?

Mastering Recoil is all about understanding its unique 'shoot-to-move' mechanic. The controls are deceptively simple: just click or tap on the screen where you want to shoot.

**Basic Controls & Mechanics:**
- **Movement:** Your character is propelled in the direct opposite direction of your shot. To move right, you must shoot left. To fly upwards, you must shoot downwards.
- **Objective:** In each level, your goal is to destroy every pink virus. Once all viruses are eliminated, a portal will open, allowing you to proceed to the next stage.
- **Combat:** Your bullets are your only weapon. A direct hit will destroy a virus. Remember that every shot you take for movement can also be used offensively if you line it up correctly.

**Progression & Strategy:**
- The game is divided into dozens of levels, each a unique puzzle with increasing difficulty. New hazards like spikes and complex layouts will test your skills.
- Many levels have limited ammo. This transforms the game from a simple shooter into a true puzzle. You must plan a route that lets you eliminate all viruses and reach the exit using only the shots you have. Think before you shoot!

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Use Walls:** Bounce off walls to change direction or fire against them to stop your momentum instantly.
2.  **Small Taps for Precision:** For small adjustments, shoot at a point very close to your character. The further you click from your character, the stronger the recoil.
3.  **Conserve Ammo:** Always be aware of your ammo count. Try to line up shots that both move you effectively and take out a virus along the way.

## What Makes Recoil Special?

Recoil stands out by building an entire game around a single, ingenious idea: movement is a consequence of attacking. Unlike other platformers where you run, jump, and shoot as separate actions, in Recoil they are one and the same. This creates a fresh and compelling gameplay loop that feels both familiar and entirely new.

Developed by Martin Magni, the game carries his signature style of minimalist design and brilliant mechanics. There are no distracting visuals or complex stories; the focus is purely on the clever, physics-based puzzles. Each level is a masterclass in design, forcing you to think about trajectory, momentum, and resource management in ways most games never ask you to. The high skill ceiling provides immense satisfaction as you progress from clumsily flying around to executing perfectly planned, ricocheting maneuvers. It’s this blend of simplicity, originality, and challenging puzzle design that makes Recoil a beloved and unforgettable indie gem.
