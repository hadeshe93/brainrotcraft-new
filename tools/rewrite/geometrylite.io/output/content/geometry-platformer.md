Leap and dodge through a deadly neon world! Test your reflexes in this precision platformer where every move counts and one mistake means starting over.

## What is Geometry Platformer?

Geometry Platformer is a challenging 2D precision platformer that tests your reflexes and patience. Played directly in your web browser, this skill-based game places you in control of a simple cube with a monumental task: navigate treacherous levels filled with geometric traps. The main objective is to guide your cube from the start of each stage to the exit portal, surviving an onslaught of spikes, spinning saws, and moving obstacles. Combining a minimalist neon aesthetic with tough-as-nails gameplay, Geometry Platformer is designed for players who love a satisfying challenge. If you're a fan of hardcore platformers like Super Meat Boy or enjoy the visual style of Geometry Dash but crave more direct control over your character's movement, you'll feel right at home in this unforgiving but rewarding geometric world.

## How to Play Geometry Platformer?

Mastering Geometry Platformer is all about precise control and learning from your mistakes. Unlike auto-runners, you have complete freedom to move, stop, and strategize your next jump.

**Core Controls:**

- **Move Left/Right:** Use the `A` and `D` keys or the `Left` and `Right Arrow` keys.
- **Jump:** Press the `W` key or the `Up Arrow` key. The longer you hold the jump button, the higher your cube will go, so mastering short hops and full leaps is crucial.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your goal is to reach the glowing green portal at the end of each level. Along the way, you'll encounter a variety of deadly hazards. Touching any red obstacle, like a spike or a blade, results in instant death and resets you to the beginning of the level. This 'one more try' loop is central to the experience, encouraging you to memorize patterns and perfect your timing. While your main goal is survival, you can also collect blue shapes scattered throughout the levels to increase your score.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Patience Over Speed:** Don't rush. Stop and observe the patterns of moving obstacles before you commit to a jump.
2.  **Learn the Physics:** Get a feel for your cube's jump height and movement speed. Practice makes perfect.
3.  **Prioritize Survival:** Collecting blue shapes is optional. Focus on clearing the level first, then go back for a high score if you want an extra challenge.

## What Makes Geometry Platformer Special?

In a sea of geometric games, Geometry Platformer stands out by giving you total control. Unlike its rhythm-based cousin, Geometry Dash, this game is a pure precision platformer. You are not on a fixed path; you can stop, think, and time your moves exactly as you see fit. This fundamental difference creates a unique challenge focused on strategic movement rather than reactive timing.

The game's brilliance lies in its simplicity. There are no complex power-ups or confusing storylines. It's just you, your cube, and a series of meticulously designed levels that are tough but fair. The minimalist neon art style serves the gameplay perfectly—every hazard is clearly visible against the dark background, ensuring that when you fail, you know it was your mistake. This blend of simple controls, high difficulty, and clean design creates an addictive loop that keeps players coming back for 'just one more try'.
