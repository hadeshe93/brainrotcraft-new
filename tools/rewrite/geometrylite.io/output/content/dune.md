Master the art of gravity in this hypnotic one-touch game. Glide over serene dunes, soar through the sky, and chase the perfect run in a test of pure timing and flow.

## What is Dune?

Dune! is a deceptively simple yet profoundly addictive arcade game that challenges your sense of timing and rhythm. Available on mobile (iOS/Android) and various web platforms, it strips gaming down to its purest form: one ball, endless dunes, and a single-touch control scheme. At its core, Dune! is a physics-based endless runner where you guide a rolling ball across a beautifully minimalist desert landscape. Your objective isn't to reach a finish line, but to achieve the highest score possible. You do this by launching your ball into the air and flying above a designated line—the longer and higher you soar, the more points you rack up. This game is perfect for anyone seeking a quick, satisfying challenge, from casual players on their daily commute to dedicated gamers obsessed with mastering physics and chasing that one perfect, high-scoring run. It’s a zen-like experience that tests your precision and rewards you with a mesmerizing sense of flow.

## How to Play Dune?

Mastering Dune! is all about understanding its simple, yet deep, physics. The entire game is controlled with a single touch, making it incredibly easy to learn but challenging to perfect.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Tap and Hold:** Press and hold your screen or mouse button to make the ball dive downwards. This is how you build momentum on the downward slope of a dune.
- **Release:** Let go of the screen or button to allow the ball to become light and launch into the air.

**Core Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your goal is to use the rolling hills to your advantage. As you approach the crest of a dune, **release** your hold to send the ball flying. The speed you built up determines how high and far you go. While airborne, aim to fly above the white line drawn across the screen to score points.

The real art of Dune! lies in the landing. You must **tap and hold** just before you land to smoothly connect with the downward slope of the next dune. This preserves your momentum for the next launch. Crashing into the face of a dune will stop you instantly.

**Beginner Tips to Soar:**
1.  **Build Momentum:** Use the first few small dunes to build up your initial speed. Don't try to fly too early.
2.  **Smooth is Fast:** Prioritize smooth landings over massive airtime at first. A perfect landing that maintains speed is more valuable than a long flight that ends in a crash.
3.  **Find the Rhythm:** Think of the game as a dance. Feel the rhythm of the dunes—dive on the downslopes, fly on the upslopes.
4.  **Look Ahead:** Always keep an eye on the next one or two dunes to anticipate your landing and prepare your dive.

## What Makes Dune Special?

In a world of complex games, Dune! stands out for its elegant simplicity and pure, physics-driven gameplay. Its magic lies not in flashy graphics or complicated controls, but in its ability to create a hypnotic 'flow state.' The minimalist aesthetic—a simple ball, clean lines, and a shifting color palette—removes all distractions, allowing you to focus entirely on the rhythm of the ride. What truly sets it apart is the high skill ceiling hidden beneath its one-touch controls. While anyone can play, mastering the perfect timing to chain together massive flights and smooth landings is a deeply rewarding challenge. This creates an incredibly addictive 'just one more try' loop as you inch closer to a new high score. Unlike other runners cluttered with power-ups and collectibles, Dune! is a pure test of skill, timing, and your ability to feel the physics of the world. It’s a meditative experience as much as it is a game.
