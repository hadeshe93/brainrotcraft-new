Zap your rivals in a neon-drenched arena! Grow your electric snake, trap your enemies, and become the king of the current in this addictive, high-voltage .io game.

## What is Powerline.io?

Powerline.io is a pulse-pounding, multiplayer arcade game that electrifies the classic 'Snake' formula. Played directly in your web browser, it drops you into a glowing grid arena filled with other players, all competing in real-time. Your objective is simple: become the longest, most powerful 'powerline' on the server. You start as a small neon line, navigating the arena to consume energy crystals that increase your length and score. But you're not alone. The arena is a battleground where you must outmaneuver and outwit dozens of other players. The game is perfect for fans of competitive, fast-paced .io titles like Slither.io, but with its own unique electric twist. Whether you have five minutes or an hour, Powerline.io offers endless, easy-to-learn but hard-to-master fun for casual and hardcore players alike.

## How to Play Powerline.io?

Mastering the current in Powerline.io is all about control, strategy, and quick reflexes.

**Controls:**
- **Movement:** Use the **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** to navigate your powerline. Unlike other snake games, movement is locked to a grid, allowing for sharp, 90-degree turns.
- **Speed Boost:** Press and hold the **Spacebar** to get a burst of speed. Be warned: this consumes your energy and makes you shorter, so use it wisely to chase down prey or make a daring escape.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your journey begins as a small line. Your primary goal is to grow by collecting glowing energy cubes scattered around the map. The real points come from defeating other players. To eliminate an opponent, you must trick them into crashing their head into your body. When they do, they explode into a long, valuable trail of energy cubes for you to collect. However, if you crash into another player's line or the arena boundary, it's game over for you!

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Start Slow:** In the beginning, focus on collecting the static, neutral cubes to build some initial length.
2.  **Use the 'Zap' Boost:** Stay close to other powerlines! This creates an electric link that gives you a speed boost *without* draining your own energy. Use this to follow larger players for protection or to hunt smaller ones.
3.  **Trap, Don't Chase:** Instead of risky head-on chases, try to circle around smaller players, tightening the loop until they have nowhere to go but into your line. This is the most effective way to score kills.

## What Makes Powerline.io Special?

Powerline.io stands out from the crowded .io genre with a few electrifying features. The most significant is the 'zap' or 'drafting' mechanic. By moving parallel to another player, you create a visible electrical current between you, granting both of you a speed boost. This creates a unique 'frenemy' dynamic—you might team up with a rival to chase down a third player, only to turn on each other moments later. It adds a layer of strategy beyond the simple eat-and-grow formula.

Another key feature is the 'King' system. The player at the top of the leaderboard is crowned, making them glow brighter and become a massive, high-value target for everyone else. Defeating the king yields a huge energy bonus, turning the leader into a hunted prize and keeping the gameplay tense and dynamic. Combined with its classic, grid-based movement reminiscent of the original Snake and a sleek, Tron-inspired neon aesthetic, Powerline.io offers a more tactical and visually distinct experience than its peers.
