Experience the full thrill of Geometry Dash, completely free in your browser! Jump, fly, and flip through iconic levels in this stunning fan-made recreation packed with features.

## What is Geometry Dash Scratch?

Geometry Dash Scratch is a breathtakingly accurate, fan-made recreation of the legendary rhythm-based platformer, built entirely on the Scratch programming platform by the renowned creator Griffpatch. This isn't just a demo; it's a nearly complete version of the game that you can play for free, directly in your web browser. Your mission is to guide a customizable geometric icon through a series of treacherous, obstacle-filled levels, all perfectly synchronized to an electrifying soundtrack. The game demands precise timing, quick reflexes, and a lot of patience. It’s a perfect challenge for both veterans of the original game looking for a convenient way to play and newcomers ready to test their skills against one of the most iconic hard-as-nails platformers ever conceived. As a '100% Pen' project on Scratch, it's also a technical marvel that showcases incredible coding skill.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Scratch?

Getting started is simple, but mastery is a true challenge. Your primary goal is to survive from the start of the level to the end without crashing into any obstacles.

**Controls:**
- **Jump:** Press `[SPACE]`, `[UP ARROW]`, or click the `[LEFT MOUSE BUTTON]`.
- **Continuous Action:** In certain modes like the Ship or Wave, you'll need to hold the button down to ascend and release it to descend.

**Game Mechanics:**
Your icon will automatically move forward. Your only job is to time your jumps and actions. You'll encounter various portals that transform your icon and change the controls:
- **Cube:** The default mode. A simple tap makes you jump.
- **Ship:** Hold to fly upwards, release to fall. Navigate tight corridors.
- **UFO:** Tap to perform a short jump in mid-air, allowing for controlled, spaced-out taps.
- **Wave:** Hold to move diagonally up, release to move diagonally down, creating a zig-zag pattern.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Use Practice Mode:** This is your best friend! It allows you to place checkpoints manually, so you can practice difficult sections without restarting the entire level.
2.  **Learn the Music:** The levels are synced to the beat. Listening to the music can help you anticipate when to jump.
3.  **Start Small:** Begin with the first level, 'Stereo Madness,' to get a feel for the physics before tackling harder stages.
4.  **Stay Calm:** You will fail—a lot. Every crash is a learning opportunity. Memorize the patterns and your muscle memory will eventually take over.

## What Makes Geometry Dash Scratch Special?

Geometry Dash Scratch stands out as a monumental achievement in fan-made games. Its most special feature is that it's a **full-featured, free-to-play experience** created by a single legendary developer, Griffpatch. Unlike the official 'Geometry Dash Lite,' which is a limited demo, this version includes a vast number of levels and, most importantly, a **fully functional Level Editor**. This allows you to design, build, and share your own creative and challenging levels with the entire Scratch community, offering virtually endless replayability. Furthermore, its status as a '100% Pen' project makes it a technical masterpiece, replicating the original's physics and feel with incredible precision, all within the constraints of the Scratch engine. It's instantly accessible in any web browser with no installation required, making it the easiest way to dive into the complete Geometry Dash experience.
