**Gameplay Mechanics & Tips:**
In **Survival (SMP)** mode, your first goal is to punch a tree to gather wood. Press 'E' to open your inventory and craft a workbench. From there, make a wooden pickaxe to mine stone for better tools and a sword for defense. Build a shelter before nightfall to protect yourself from zombies and other hostile mobs.

In **Creative** mode, you have unlimited resources. Open your inventory to access every block type. Find an empty plot of land and claim it (often with a command like `/plot auto`) to start building your masterpiece without others interfering.

For **War** and **Infection** modes, speed is everything. Immediately sprint to find chests, which contain weapons, armor, and potions. Left-click to attack with your sword or bow. Keep moving and jumping to make yourself a harder target. In Infection, if you're a survivor, run and hide; if you're a zombie, work with other zombies to corner the humans.

## What Makes MineFun.io Special?

MineFun.io stands out by offering the massive appeal of a Minecraft-style universe with the instant accessibility of an .io game. Its biggest strength is its 'all-in-one' design.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is MineFun.io free to play?

Yes, MineFun.io is completely free to play. It runs in your web browser, so you don't need to download or purchase anything. Just open the website and start playing immediately.

### Can I play MineFun.io on my phone or Chromebook?

MineFun.io works best on devices with a keyboard and mouse, making it ideal for PCs and Chromebooks. While it might load on a mobile browser, the controls are not optimized for touchscreens, so the experience will be difficult.

### How do I save my progress or builds?

Your progress is saved on the specific server you play on, not on your account globally. In Creative mode, you can usually claim a plot of land using a chat command (like `/plot claim`). This saves your build on that server, so you can return to it later.

### What is the best game mode for a new player?

Creative mode is the perfect starting point. It allows you to get comfortable with the movement and building controls in a safe environment with no enemies or pressure. For practicing movement, Parkour mode is also an excellent, low-stress choice.

### How do I switch between items like my sword and pickaxe?

You can use the number keys (1-9) on your keyboard to quickly select any item in your hotbar at the bottom of the screen. Alternatively, you can use the mouse scroll wheel to cycle through the items in your hotbar.
