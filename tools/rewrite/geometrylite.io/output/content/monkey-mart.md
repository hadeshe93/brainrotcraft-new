## What is Monkey Mart?

Monkey Mart is a vibrant and addictive idle/management game where you take control of a hardworking monkey entrepreneur. Available primarily as a free-to-play browser game and on mobile devices, your main objective is to transform a humble fruit stand into a bustling supermarket empire. You'll start small, planting and harvesting bananas, but will quickly expand your operations to include a variety of products like corn, eggs, milk, and more. The game's charming art style, simple controls, and satisfying progression loop make it perfect for casual gamers of all ages. It’s an engaging simulation that combines resource management with fast-paced action, challenging you to keep your shelves stocked, your customers happy, and your cash register ringing as you grow your business one aisle at a time.

## How to Play Monkey Mart?

Getting started in Monkey Mart is incredibly intuitive. Your main goal is to manage the entire supply chain of your store, from farm to checkout.

**Basic Controls:**
- **PC:** Use the WASD or Arrow Keys to move your monkey around the mart.
- **Mobile:** A virtual joystick will appear on-screen for movement.
All interactions—like harvesting crops, stocking shelves, and collecting cash—are performed automatically by simply standing near the target object.

**Gameplay Mechanics & Progression:**
1.  **Plant & Harvest:** Begin by planting your first crop (bananas) and wait for it to grow. Once ripe, run over it to automatically harvest.
2.  **Stock Shelves:** Carry your produce to the corresponding empty aisle. Customers will automatically take what they need.
3.  **Collect Cash:** After shopping, customers will queue at the cash register. Stand near the register to collect your earnings.
4.  **Upgrade & Expand:** Use your money to unlock new aisles, products (like chicken coops for eggs or cows for milk), and powerful upgrades for your character. You can increase your movement speed and how many items you can carry at once.
5.  **Hire Help:** As your mart grows, you can hire other monkeys to automate tasks like stocking shelves, farming, and manning the cash register, turning your active work into a thriving idle enterprise.

## What Makes Monkey Mart Special?

Monkey Mart stands out from other management sims with its delightful simplicity and hands-on approach. Unlike games buried in menus and spreadsheets, your progress is driven by direct action and movement, creating a seamless and engaging gameplay loop. The visual progression is incredibly satisfying; you physically watch your single banana stand evolve into a multi-aisle supermarket filled with diverse products and busy customers. The introduction of helper monkeys adds a fantastic idle game element, allowing you to strategically automate your business and focus on expansion. It’s this perfect blend of active participation and passive income generation, all wrapped in a charming, universally appealing monkey-themed package, that makes the game so addictive and beloved by players looking for a fun, low-stress, and rewarding experience.
