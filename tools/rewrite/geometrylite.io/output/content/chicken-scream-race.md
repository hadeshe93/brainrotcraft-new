Control a chicken with your voice! Whisper to make it walk, scream to make it jump, and navigate a world of treacherous platforms in this hilariously chaotic endless runner.

## What is Chicken Scream Race?

Chicken Scream Race is a unique 2D side-scrolling platformer where your voice is the only controller you need. Available on mobile (iOS/Android) and web browsers, this game throws traditional controls out the window for a fresh, laugh-out-loud experience. The main objective is simple: guide your chicken as far as possible across an endless series of platforms, pits, and traps to achieve the highest score. The twist? You make the chicken move by making noise. Gentle sounds cause it to walk, while loud shouts make it leap into the air. This simple yet brilliant concept makes Chicken Scream Race an instant hit for casual gamers, families, and streamers looking for hilarious content. It’s less about precision and more about the fun of controlling a game in a completely new way. Prepare for some strange looks as you start whispering and yelling at your screen!

## How to Play Chicken Scream Race?

Mastering Chicken Scream Race is all about mastering your own voice. The controls are intuitive but require practice. To start, you'll need to grant the game microphone access.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Walk:** Speak softly, hum, or make any low-volume, continuous sound. The chicken will start to walk forward.
- **Jump:** Yell, shout, or make a short, loud noise. The chicken will perform a jump. The height and length of the jump are determined by the loudness and duration of your sound—a quick 'hop!' will result in a small jump, while a loud 'JUMP!' will send your chicken soaring.
- **Stop:** Silence. If you don't make any noise, your chicken will stand still. Use this to time your movements and wait for the perfect moment to proceed.

**Gameplay & Tips:**
Your goal is to survive for as long as possible. You'll earn points for the distance you travel. As you progress, you'll encounter increasingly difficult obstacles like moving platforms, deadly spikes, and wide gaps. 

**For Beginners:**
1.  **Find a Quiet Spot:** Background noise can trigger unwanted movements. Play in a quiet room for the best control.
2.  **Practice Your Tones:** Spend a few minutes just humming to walk and saying 'go' to jump. Find a comfortable volume for each action.
3.  **Use Short, Sharp Sounds for Jumps:** A quick, sharp sound gives you more control over your jump height than a long, drawn-out scream. This helps avoid overshooting small platforms.
4.  **Stay Calm and Steady:** For walking sections, a steady hum is often more reliable than talking, which can have fluctuating volumes.

## What Makes Chicken Scream Race Special?

The undeniable charm of Chicken Scream Race lies in its brilliantly simple and novel control scheme. While countless endless runners use taps and swipes, this game transforms your voice into the ultimate controller, creating a unique bond between you and your on-screen chicken. This mechanic alone sets it apart, turning gameplay into a performance that is just as fun to watch as it is to play. It’s the perfect party game or streaming title, guaranteed to generate laughter as players (and spectators) witness the chaos of controlling a character by yelling at it. The game's minimalist design keeps the focus squarely on the voice-driven action. There are no complex menus or convoluted power-ups—it's just you, your voice, and a determined chicken against the world. This purity of concept is why players love it; it’s an accessible, instantly understandable, and endlessly amusing challenge.
