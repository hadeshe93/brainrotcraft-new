Test your patience and precision in Gorilla Adventure! Swing your hammer to climb a surreal world in this brutally challenging physics-based platformer.

## What is Gorilla Adventure?

Gorilla Adventure is a challenging physics-based climbing game that will push your skills to the absolute limit. Inspired by unforgiving classics like 'Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy,' this game falls into the 'rage game' genre, designed for players who crave a true test of determination. You control a gorilla confined to a pot, armed only with a large hammer. Your singular objective is to climb an immense, surreal structure that stretches from the ground into outer space. Played directly in your web browser, the game is a single-player journey of persistence. There are no enemies to fight, only the relentless pull of gravity and the intricate, often treacherous, level design. Gorilla Adventure is for the patient, the persistent, and anyone who gets a deep sense of satisfaction from overcoming extreme difficulty. If you enjoy mastering a difficult mechanic and celebrating every inch of progress, this adventure is for you.

## How to Play Gorilla Adventure?

Mastering Gorilla Adventure is all about control and patience. Your only tool is your hammer, and your only input is the mouse.

**Controls & Mechanics:**
- **Movement:** The game is controlled entirely with your mouse. Move your mouse to swing the hammer in a full circle around the gorilla.
- **Climbing:** Use the hammer to push, pull, and hook onto the environment. To climb, you might hook the head of the hammer over a ledge and pull yourself up, or push off a surface to propel yourself sideways or upwards.
- **Physics:** The physics are intentionally weighty and challenging. Your movements must be precise and deliberate. A frantic swing will often result in a loss of control.

**Progression & Tips:**
There are no checkpoints or save points. Progress is measured by how high you can climb. If you fall, you will drop all the way down until you hit a surface, potentially losing minutes or even hours of progress. This is the core challenge.

**Beginner's Tips:**
1.  **Go Slow:** Small, controlled mouse movements are far more effective than large, fast swings.
2.  **Observe First:** Before attempting a tricky section, take a moment to study the terrain and plan your moves.
3.  **Use Hooks:** The most reliable way to gain height is to hook your hammer on an edge and carefully pull yourself up.
4.  **Stay Calm:** Frustration leads to rushed movements and mistakes. If you fall, take a deep breath. The climb back up is part of the game.

## What Makes Gorilla Adventure Special?

Gorilla Adventure stands out by delivering a famously punishing genre experience for free, right in your browser. Its primary appeal lies in its brutal but fair challenge. The game is built around the emotional rollercoaster of making painstaking progress, suffering a catastrophic fall, and finding the determination to climb again. The immense satisfaction of conquering a section you were stuck on is the ultimate reward.

Unlike more complex platformers, its beauty is in its simplicity. The one-input (mouse only) control scheme is easy to understand but incredibly difficult to master, creating a high skill ceiling. The surreal, vertical journey adds to its unique charm, taking you from a familiar urban junkyard to bizarre objects floating in the cosmos. It’s not just a game; it’s a test of willpower disguised as a quirky adventure about a gorilla with a hammer, and that's why players who love a challenge keep coming back.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do you control the gorilla?

You control the gorilla's hammer exclusively with your mouse. Moving the mouse rotates the hammer around the pot. There are no keyboard controls for jumping or walking. All movement—pushing, pulling, and swinging—is generated by interacting with the environment using the hammer.

### Is Gorilla Adventure supposed to be this hard?

Yes, absolutely. Gorilla Adventure is a 'rage game,' a genre known for its high difficulty. The challenge comes from the precise physics and the lack of checkpoints. Falling and losing progress is a core part of the experience, making every upward move feel like a major achievement.

### Can I save my progress in the game?

There are no official save points or checkpoints. The game is designed to be a continuous climb. If you close your browser tab, you will have to start over from the beginning. The only way to 'save' is to leave the game open in your browser, but a fall can still send you right back to the start.

### Is Gorilla Adventure available on mobile or other platforms?

Gorilla Adventure is primarily designed as a free-to-play web browser game for PC. While you might find games with similar names or concepts on mobile app stores, they are likely not the official version and may have different controls, physics, and advertisements.
