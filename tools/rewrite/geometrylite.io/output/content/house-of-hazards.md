Welcome to the world's most dangerous home! Challenge your friends in a chaotic race to finish chores while they trigger absurd traps to stop you in your tracks.

## What is House of Hazards?

House of Hazards is a physics-based, local multiplayer party game where everyday household chores become a life-or-death struggle. Playable directly in your web browser, this game pits you and up to three friends against each other in a series of hilarious and chaotic rounds. The main objective changes depending on your role. One player is the 'Contestant,' tasked with completing a simple checklist of activities like watering a plant or making coffee. The other players are the 'Hazards,' controlling the house itself to activate traps—from firing toasters to falling chandeliers—to knock the contestant out. With its ragdoll physics and slapstick humor, House of Hazards is perfect for players who love games like Gang Beasts or Human: Fall Flat and are looking for a fun, competitive experience to share with friends on the couch. The first person to successfully complete their list of chores wins the game!

## How to Play House of Hazards?

The game is played in rounds, with players taking turns as the Contestant while others control the hazards. The first player to win a round as the Contestant wins the whole game.

**As the Contestant:**
Your goal is to complete the tasks on your checklist, shown at the top of the screen. You must navigate from one end of the house to the other, interacting with objects while avoiding traps sprung by your friends. Stay alert and watch for visual cues—like a wiggling light fixture—that signal an imminent hazard.

**As a Hazard:**
Your goal is simple: stop the Contestant! Each hazard player is assigned a specific trap. Time your activation perfectly to knock the player out. You can see which trap you control by the colored icon over your character's head. Work with the other hazard players to create devastating trap combos.

**Controls:**
*   **Player 1:** Use A/D to move, W to jump, and S to crouch or activate your assigned hazard.
*   **Player 2:** Use J/L to move, I to jump, and K to crouch or activate your assigned hazard.
*(Note: Playing with 3 or 4 players typically requires game controllers.)*

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Contestants:** Be patient! Rushing will get you knocked out. Use the crouch button to dodge high-flying projectiles like toast and to slide under swinging doors.
*   **Hazards:** Timing is everything. Wait for the Contestant to be in the most vulnerable position before you strike. Communication with other hazard players is your best weapon.

## What Makes House of Hazards Special?

House of Hazards stands out by turning a simple home into an arena of slapstick comedy and friendly rivalry. Its core appeal lies in the chaotic local multiplayer experience—this isn't a game you play quietly. It's designed for shouting, laughing, and high-fiving with friends in the same room.

The hilarious ragdoll physics ensure that every failure is as entertaining as any victory. Watching your character get launched across the room by a toaster is a core part of the fun. The unique dual-role system, where you constantly switch between being the hunted contestant and a mischievous hazard-trapper, keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging for everyone involved. To top it all off, the 'Wheel of Misfortune' spins between rounds, introducing random new rules or environmental changes that guarantee no two games are ever the same, offering endless replayability.
