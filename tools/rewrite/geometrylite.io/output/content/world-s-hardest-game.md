## What is World’s Hardest Game?

Welcome to the ultimate test of skill and perseverance, famously known as the World's Hardest Game. This iconic browser-based puzzle-arcade game challenges you to do one simple thing: survive. You control a red square with the sole objective of navigating a field of moving blue obstacles, collecting every yellow coin, and reaching the safety of the green beacon to complete the level. Originally a Flash classic that defined a generation of 'rage games,' it's now fully playable on modern web browsers. Don't let the minimalist design fool you; each of the 30 levels is a masterclass in brutal, yet fair, design that will push your reflexes and strategic thinking to the absolute limit. This game is built for determined players who crave a true challenge and find immense satisfaction in overcoming seemingly impossible odds. Every death is a lesson, and every victory is earned through sheer focus and precision. Are you ready to prove the title wrong?

## How to Play World’s Hardest Game?

The rules are simple, but mastery is a different story. Your mission is to guide your red square from one green safe zone to the other, but there's a catch: you must collect all the yellow circles on the screen before you can finish. Standing in your way are relentless blue circles, moving in complex, predetermined patterns. One touch from them, and you're sent back to the start, adding another tally to your death counter.

**Controls:**
*   **Movement:** Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** to move your red square in any direction.

**Core Mechanics:**
1.  **Start & End:** Begin in a green zone. Your goal is to reach the other green zone (or return to the start) after collecting all coins.
2.  **Collect:** You must grab every single yellow circle to unlock the level's exit.
3.  **Avoid:** The blue circles are your enemies. Learn their paths and timing to weave through them.

**Tips for Beginners:**
*   **Observe First:** Don't rush in. Spend a few seconds watching the obstacle patterns to plan your route.
*   **Divide and Conquer:** Focus on getting to the next coin or a temporary safe spot, rather than trying to clear the whole level in one go.
*   **Embrace Failure:** You will die. A lot. See the death counter not as a sign of failure, but as a measure of your dedication. Each attempt teaches you more about the level's timing and rhythm.

The game is famous for its 'just one more try' loop; with instant respawns and short levels, you're immediately back in the action, determined to beat the pattern that just defeated you. The immense sense of accomplishment after conquering a difficult stage is a feeling few other games can replicate. It’s not just a game; it’s a benchmark for player patience and precision.
