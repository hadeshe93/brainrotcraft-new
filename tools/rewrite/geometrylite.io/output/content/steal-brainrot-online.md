## How to Play Steal Brainrot Online?

Getting into the action is simple, but staying on top is a true challenge. Your goal is to have the most Brainrots by the end of the match.

**Controls:**

- **PC:** Use `WASD` to move your character, `Spacebar` to jump, and your `Mouse` to look around and aim your movement.
- **Mobile:** Use the on-screen joystick to move and the dedicated button to jump.

**Core Mechanics:**
Your match begins as you spawn into a dynamic map. Keep your eyes peeled for Brainrots, which randomly appear across the arena. Run over them to add them to your collection—you'll see your counter go up. Here's the twist: if another player touches you, you are instantly eliminated and drop your _entire_ stash of Brainrots! This creates a massive loot pile that triggers a frenzy as everyone rushes to claim the spoils. You'll respawn after a few seconds to get back into the fight.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Play Defensively:** When you're just starting, learn the map layout and avoid big groups. A large collection makes you a prime target.
2.  **Be a Vulture:** Let other players fight it out. When one eliminates the other and a pile of Brainrots drops, swoop in to steal the loot while they're distracted.
3.  **Use Your Environment:** Use ramps and high ground to get a better view of the map, spot new Brainrot spawns, and plan your escape routes.

## What Makes Steal Brainrot Online Special?

Unlike other games, there's no permanent loss, so the frustration is minimal and the fun is maximized.

Furthermore, the game is a living tribute to internet culture. Its currency isn't gold or gems; it's the latest viral memes, making it incredibly relevant and relatable for its audience. This focus on hyper-current humor creates a shared experience for players who live and breathe online trends. Combined with its extreme accessibility—free-to-play in any web browser with no downloads required—Steal Brainrot Online delivers instant, shareable, and ridiculously entertaining gameplay that's hard to find anywhere else.
