## How to Play American Football Bowl?

Mastering American Football Bowl involves a mix of on-field skill and off-field strategy. On offense, you are in direct control. 

**Basic Controls:**
- **Snap Ball:** Press the `Spacebar` to start the play.
- **Aim Throw:** Move your `Mouse` to aim the passing arc. You'll see a trajectory line showing where the ball will go.
- **Throw Ball:** `Left-click` to throw. A quick tap results in a high, arcing lob pass, perfect for getting the ball over defenders. Holding the click down before releasing fires a fast, powerful bullet pass for tight windows.
- **Movement:** After catching the ball (or if you're scrambling as the QB), use the `A/D` or `Left/Right Arrow` keys to run and dodge defenders.

On defense, your role is purely strategic. You choose a defensive play from the options provided and watch your AI-controlled players execute it.

**Progression & Tips:**
Winning games earns you Coaching Credits, the game's currency. Use these credits in the front office to sign free agents, renew contracts, and upgrade your facilities like training and rehab. 

**Beginner's Tip:** In the beginning, focus on your passing game. Before the snap, watch for the receiver whose route is highlighted—they are your primary target. Learn when to use a lob pass versus a bullet pass, as this is key to avoiding interceptions. Don't be afraid to spend credits on a good quarterback early on; it will make a huge difference.

## What Makes American Football Bowl Special?

American Football Bowl stands out by perfectly blending simple, arcade-style gameplay with deep team management. Unlike hyper-realistic sims, it focuses on the most exciting part of offense: being the quarterback. The intuitive mouse-based throwing mechanic is easy to learn but offers a high skill ceiling, making every touchdown pass feel earned. 

What truly makes it special is the strategic layer off the field. You're not just a player; you're the GM. Deciding whether to spend your hard-earned Coaching Credits on a star wide receiver or upgrading your training facilities has real, lasting consequences on your team's success. This combination of satisfying on-field action and meaningful management decisions creates an incredibly addictive loop. The charming pixel graphics and retro sound design add a powerful dose of nostalgia, appealing to anyone who grew up with classic console sports games. It's the perfect football fix without the complex playbooks or lengthy time commitment.
