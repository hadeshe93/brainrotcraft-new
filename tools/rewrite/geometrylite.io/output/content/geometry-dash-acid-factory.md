## What is Geometry Dash Acid Factory?

Geometry Dash Acid Factory is not a standalone game, but a famous user-created level within the main Geometry Dash title. Created by the talented player Berkoo, it serves as the thrilling first stage of the in-game Poison Gauntlet. As a rhythm-based action platformer, your goal is to navigate a single, auto-scrolling icon through a treacherous factory environment. The level's theme is a standout, featuring a dark, industrial setting illuminated by vibrant, toxic-green neon lights, pipes, and sawblades. Your primary objective is to survive from start to finish by timing your jumps and movements to the beat of the music. Designed for new to intermediate players, Acid Factory is the perfect introduction to the Gauntlet challenges, testing your rhythm and reflexes. It's available on all platforms where the full Geometry Dash game is sold, including PC (Steam), iOS, and Android.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Acid Factory?

The controls for Acid Factory are the classic one-touch mechanics of Geometry Dash. You'll use a single button—a mouse click, a screen tap, or the spacebar—to make your icon jump and interact with the level. The function of your tap changes based on your icon's form. As the Cube, you'll perform short hops over spikes and saws. As the Ship, you'll hold to fly upward and release to descend, navigating tight, hazardous corridors. In the Ball sections, a tap will instantly switch your gravity, allowing you to roll along ceilings and floors. Progression in Acid Factory is tied to the Poison Gauntlet; completing it unlocks the next level in the sequence. For a true mastery challenge, hunt for the three hidden Secret Coins. 

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Use Practice Mode:** This is essential for learning the level's layout without the frustration of restarting. You can place checkpoints to master tricky sections.
2.  **Listen to the Music:** The level is perfectly synced to the track "Final Boss" by Acid-Notation. Let the beat guide your taps; most obstacles are designed to be cleared in time with the rhythm.
3.  **Coin Locations:** The first coin is in a cube section, requiring a jump onto a hidden block. The second is in a tight upper passage during the ship sequence. The third is found by dropping into a pit in the final ball section.

## What Makes Geometry Dash Acid Factory Special?
