Defy gravity in a mind-bending 3D world! Run, jump, and rotate through treacherous space tunnels in this fast-paced, action-packed platformer.

## What is Run 3D?

Welcome to the adrenaline-fueled universe of Run 3D, a classic action platformer that challenges your reflexes and perception of physics. In this game, you take control of a nimble alien as it sprints automatically through a series of complex, 3D architectural tunnels floating in space. Your primary objective isn't just to survive, but to master the environment. The core concept revolves around a unique gravity-defying mechanic: you can run on the walls and even the ceiling by simply moving to the edge of your current surface. The game is typically played in a web browser and appeals to fans of skill-based, fast-paced challenges. While often categorized as an endless runner, Run 3D's main 'Explore Mode' features a vast map of distinct, handcrafted levels to conquer, offering a clear sense of progression alongside its traditional 'Infinite Mode' for high-score chasers. It’s a true test of timing, planning, and precision.

## How to Play Run 3D?

Getting started in Run 3D is simple, but mastering its physics is the real challenge. Your character runs forward automatically, so your focus is purely on navigation and survival.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Move/Rotate:** Use the Left/Right Arrow Keys or A/D keys. Moving doesn't just sidestep; it rotates the entire tunnel, allowing you to run on the walls and ceiling.
- **Jump:** Press the Spacebar or the Up Arrow Key. The length of your jump depends on how long you hold the key.

**Core Mechanics:**
The goal is to reach the end of each level (in Explore Mode) or run as far as possible (in Infinite Mode) without falling into the void. You must jump over gaps and avoid brittle tiles that crumble after you touch them. The key to success is using the rotation mechanic to find a safe path. If a gap is too wide, try running on a nearby wall to bypass it entirely.

**Progression & Tips for Beginners:**
As you beat levels in Explore Mode, you'll unlock new paths on the galaxy map and new playable characters. Each character has unique abilities—some are faster, some jump higher, and some have special skills like a mid-air jump. 
- **Look Ahead:** Always try to scan the path ahead to anticipate gaps and plan your route.
- **Control Your Jumps:** Not every gap requires a full-power jump. Practice short hops for better precision.
- **Experiment with Characters:** Once unlocked, try different characters on tough levels. The right ability can make a huge difference.

## What Makes Run 3D Special?

Run 3D stands out in the crowded runner genre with its brilliant and unique core mechanic: gravity-defying world rotation. Unlike games where you just dodge left and right, here you actively manipulate your path by running on walls and ceilings, turning every level into a 3D puzzle. This adds an incredible layer of strategy and spatial reasoning.

The game also offers substantial content through its two primary modes. The level-based 'Explore Mode' provides a satisfying sense of progression as you traverse a galaxy map, unlocking new challenges. For purists, 'Infinite Mode' delivers that classic, high-score-chasing thrill. Furthermore, the roster of unlockable characters isn't just cosmetic. Each alien possesses distinct skills, encouraging you to replay levels with different strategies to find the optimal path. It’s this combination of innovative gameplay, deep content, and a high skill ceiling that makes Run 3D a timeless and beloved challenge.
