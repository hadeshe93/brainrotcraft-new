Unleash your creativity and design the ultimate Geometry Dash wave challenges. Build, test, and conquer your own devious levels in this fan-favorite sandbox editor.

## What is Wave Editor?

Wave Editor is a fan-made creative sandbox game inspired by the iconic wave mode from Geometry Dash. Created by Kokim, this browser-based game strips away the complexities of a full level editor and focuses purely on designing, building, and playing custom wave-based challenges. It's a unique blend of a rhythm-platformer and a level-creation tool, playable on both PC and mobile devices. Your main objective is to use a suite of intuitive tools to place obstacles, portals, and decorations, constructing a level from your imagination. Then, seamlessly switch to play mode and attempt to navigate your own creation. Wave Editor is perfect for Geometry Dash enthusiasts who love the wave game mode, aspiring level designers looking for a simple yet powerful tool, and any player who wants to test the limits of their creativity and reflexes.

## How to Play Wave Editor?

Mastering Wave Editor involves understanding its two primary modes: Edit Mode and Play Mode.

**Controls & Gameplay:**
In Play Mode, you control the wave with a single action. Hold down the left mouse button or tap and hold the screen to make the wave travel diagonally upward. Release the button or your finger to let it glide diagonally downward. Your goal is to skillfully maneuver through the obstacles you've placed, surviving from start to finish.

**Building Your Level (Edit Mode):**
The interface is designed for quick creation. A toolbar contains all the building blocks you need:

- **Object Selection:** Choose from various spikes, blocks, and special items like speed portals, size-changing portals, and dual-mode portals.
- **Placing Objects:** After selecting an item, simply click or tap on the stage to place it. You can drag items to reposition them precisely.
- **Deleting Objects:** To remove a mistake, select the trash can icon. It will turn red, indicating Delete Mode is active. Click any object to erase it. Click the trash can again to turn it off.
- **Navigation:** Use the two-arrow button to pan your view across the canvas, allowing you to build expansive levels beyond the initial screen.
- **Settings:** Customize your level's look by changing the background color via the settings (cog) icon.

**Beginner Tips:**
Start by building a small, simple section and immediately use the 'Play' button to test it. This rapid feedback loop is key to learning. Experiment with different portal combinations to create surprising and dynamic gameplay shifts.

## What Makes Wave Editor Special?

Wave Editor stands out by dedicating itself entirely to the beloved wave game mode from Geometry Dash, offering a focused and refined creative experience. Its greatest strength is its simplicity and accessibility. Unlike the official game's complex editor, Wave Editor features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that allows players to bring their ideas to life in minutes, not hours.

The ability to instantly switch between building and testing with a single click is a game-changer. This seamless transition encourages rapid prototyping and fine-tuning, making the creative process fluid and engaging. This immediate feedback loop is what players love most—you're not just a creator, but the first person to test your own devious contraptions. It transforms level design from a daunting task into a fun, iterative puzzle. It’s the perfect sandbox for both seasoned GD veterans wanting to draft wave ideas and newcomers looking for a friendly introduction to level design.
