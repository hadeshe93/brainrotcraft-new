## What is Titans Clicker?

Welcome to the addicting world of Titans Clicker, a thrilling idle RPG that combines the satisfaction of clicker games with deep strategic progression. Available directly in your web browser on PC or mobile, there's no download required to jump into the action. Your primary mission is to defend the kingdom from an endless onslaught of monsters and their colossal titan leaders. You are the Sword Master, and your power grows with every tap. As you vanquish foes, you'll earn gold to upgrade your abilities, hire a powerful team of heroes who fight for you automatically, and unlock devastating skills. Titans Clicker is perfect for fans of incremental games who love seeing numbers go up, as well as players looking for a rewarding adventure that can be enjoyed in short, active bursts or left to progress idly in the background.

## How to Play Titans Clicker?

Getting started in Titans Clicker is simple: just click or tap on the monster on your screen to attack! Every tap deals damage and defeating enemies earns you gold. Your journey to becoming a legendary titan-slayer revolves around a core loop of progression.

**1. Upgrade Your Power:** Use your earned gold in the upgrade menu. Initially, focus on increasing your 'Click Damage' to make your taps more effective. 

**2. Hire Heroes:** As soon as you can, start hiring heroes. These allies attack automatically, providing a constant stream of Damage Per Second (DPS). This is the 'idle' part of the game, allowing you to earn gold even when you're not actively clicking. Keep leveling up your heroes to boost their DPS.

**3. Defeat Bosses & Advance Stages:** Each stage consists of several regular monsters followed by a powerful Titan boss with a time limit. Save your active skills—like damage boosts and auto-tap storms—for these tough encounters to ensure victory and advance to the next stage.

**4. Prestige for Permanent Gains:** When your progress slows down and bosses feel impossible to beat, it's time to 'Prestige'. This powerful feature resets your stage, gold, and hero levels, but rewards you with valuable artifacts. These artifacts provide massive, permanent boosts that will make your next journey through the stages much faster and more powerful. Don't be afraid to Prestige; it's the key to long-term success.

## What Makes Titans Clicker Special?

Titans Clicker masterfully blends active, high-intensity gameplay with rewarding idle mechanics. Unlike many clicker games that demand constant attention, you can choose your playstyle. Go all-in, tapping furiously and strategically deploying skills to crush bosses, or let your loyal team of heroes handle the fight, collecting gold for you while you're away. Its greatest strength is its accessibility—being a browser-based game, it requires no installation, allowing you to dive in instantly on any device. The true magic lies in the satisfying progression loop and the 'Prestige' system. This adds a compelling layer of strategy, turning a simple clicker into a long-term quest for optimization. Watching your power multiply after each Prestige run is incredibly rewarding and is what keeps players coming back to defeat just one more titan.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I play Titans Clicker on my phone?

Yes! Titans Clicker is a browser-based game built with HTML5, making it fully compatible with both desktop and mobile web browsers. You can play on your PC, smartphone, or tablet without needing to download or install any app.

### I'm stuck on a boss. What should I do?

If a boss is too tough, go back to a previous stage and 'farm' monsters for gold. Use this gold to heavily upgrade your most effective heroes and your own click damage. Make sure to save all your active skills for the boss fight to maximize your damage within the time limit. If progress is still too slow, it's a strong sign that you're ready to Prestige.

### What is Prestige and when should I use it?

Prestige is a core mechanic where you reset your stage progress, gold, and hero levels in exchange for powerful artifacts. These artifacts give permanent global bonuses, like increased damage or more gold from monsters. You should Prestige when your progress slows to a crawl and defeating the next boss seems to take forever. It's the main way to break through walls and reach higher stages.

### Do I have to click all the time to make progress?

Not at all. While active clicking is great for pushing through tough bosses, the majority of your long-term damage and gold income will come from your heroes' automatic DPS. You can leave the game running and your heroes will defeat monsters for you, making it an excellent idle game for passive progress.
