## How to Play Roller Baller?

Getting started in Roller Baller is easy, but mastering the course requires focus and quick fingers. Your goal is to guide the ball as far as you can while racking up points and collecting gems.

**Core Controls:**
- **Movement:** Use the **A/D keys** or the **Left/Right Arrow keys** to steer the ball.
- **Jump:** Press the **Spacebar** to leap over gaps or dodge low-lying obstacles. Timing your jumps is crucial for survival!

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your ball moves forward automatically at an increasing speed. Your job is to make precise adjustments to stay on the track. You'll encounter a variety of challenges:
- **Ramps:** Use these to gain air and cross wide gaps.
- **Moving Platforms:** Anticipate their movement to land safely.
- **Red Obstacles:** Avoid these at all costs! Hitting them means an instant game over.
- **Boost Pads:** Roll over these for a burst of speed, but be ready for the challenge that follows.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Look Ahead:** Always keep your eyes focused down the track to anticipate upcoming turns and obstacles.
2.  **Subtle Movements:** Small, controlled taps are more effective than holding down the keys.
3.  **Conserve Your Jumps:** Don't jump unnecessarily. Save it for when you absolutely need to clear a gap or hazard.
4.  **Survival First:** In the beginning, prioritize staying on the course over grabbing every single gem. You'll collect more in the long run by staying alive longer.

## What Makes Roller Baller Special?

While Roller Baller shares its DNA with other endless runners, it stands out with its unique blend of precision steering and active platforming. Unlike games that are solely about navigating a slope, Roller Baller introduces a vital jump mechanic, transforming the gameplay into a true 3D platforming challenge. This gives you more agency and control over your survival, allowing for clutch saves and skillful maneuvers that feel incredibly rewarding.

The track design is another key differentiator. It's not just a random, winding path; it’s a thoughtfully constructed gauntlet of trampolines, moving platforms, and tricky barriers that test a wider range of skills. Players love the game for its pure, skill-based nature. There are no complex stories or upgrades—just you, the ball, and the track. This creates an addictive, high-score-chasing loop that is perfect for quick gaming sessions, delivering a potent dose of adrenaline and satisfaction with every successful run.
