## How to Play Friday Night Sprunki?

Getting into the groove in Friday Night Sprunki is straightforward, but mastering it is the real test. Your goal is to outperform Sprunki in a musical duel.

**Core Gameplay:**
As the song plays, colored arrows will scroll up from the bottom of the screen. Your task is to press the corresponding key on your keyboard (Arrow Keys or WASD) at the exact moment the scrolling arrow overlaps with the stationary gray arrow outline at the top. A successful hit is rated 'Sick' or 'Good' and builds your score.

**The Health Bar:**
At the bottom of the screen is a health bar with your icon (Boyfriend) on one side and Sprunki's on the other. Hitting notes correctly will push the bar towards Sprunki's side, while missing notes or pressing the wrong key will cause it to slide towards yours. If your icon is pushed all the way to the edge, you lose the round and will have to restart the song.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Listen First, Watch Second:** The notes are synced to the music. Try to feel the beat to anticipate the timing of the arrows.
*   **Stay Calm and Recover:** Don't panic if you miss a few notes. Focus on the next incoming arrow to break the opponent's momentum and regain control.
*   **Two-Handed Play:** If you find complex patterns difficult, try using one hand for two arrows (e.g., left and down) and the other hand for the other two (up and right). This can improve your speed and accuracy.

## What Makes Friday Night Sprunki Special?
