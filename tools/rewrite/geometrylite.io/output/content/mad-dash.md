Unleash your inner beast and charge through a lethal pixel maze. Master the mid-air dash, outsmart brutal traps, and fight for your freedom in this high-octane precision platformer.

## What is Mad Dash?

Mad Dash is a fast-paced 2D pixel-art platformer from Liminal Creations that tests your reflexes and resolve. You play as a powerful minotaur trapped in a deadly, neon-lit labyrinth. Your only goal is survival and escape. The game blends the tight controls of classic platformers with the relentless, one-more-try difficulty of modern rage games. Each level is a complex maze filled with spikes, chasms, and devious traps that require split-second timing to overcome. As you progress, the environment itself works against you—colors shift, the pace quickens, and new hazards appear without warning. Primarily a web-browser game, Mad Dash is designed for players who love a steep but rewarding challenge and find satisfaction in mastering difficult mechanics. If you thrive on pixel-perfect jumps and the thrill of clearing a seemingly impossible stage, the Minotaur's maze is waiting for you.

## How to Play Mad Dash?

Your objective in Mad Dash is to guide the minotaur from the start of each maze to the glowing exit portal. Mastering the controls is your first step to freedom.

**Controls:**
- **Move Left/Right:** A/D or ←/→ Keys
- **Jump:** W, Up Arrow, or Spacebar
- **Dash:** Double-tap your jump key in mid-air

The core mechanic is the 'Mad Dash.' Unlike a standard double-jump, the dash propels you horizontally in the air. To execute it, you must first jump and then press the jump key again while airborne. This move is essential for crossing wide gaps, dodging rows of spikes from above, and reaching distant platforms. Timing is everything; a dash performed too early or too late will send you into a trap.

As you conquer levels, the game's difficulty ramps up significantly. New mechanics are introduced, such as pressure plates that invert gravity, disappearing platforms, and homing projectiles. Success isn't just about reaction time—it's about learning level layouts and creating a fluid, uninterrupted run.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Isolate the Dash:** Practice the jump-then-dash mechanic in early levels until it feels natural.
2.  **Observe Patterns:** Don't just run blindly. Watch trap cycles and enemy movements to find your opening.
3.  **Stay Grounded When Possible:** Air-time makes you vulnerable. Use your dash strategically, not just because you can.

## What Makes Mad Dash Special?

While Mad Dash shares DNA with other tough-as-nails platformers, it carves its own identity with the 'Minotaur's Rage' system and its unique movement mechanics. Unlike auto-runners, Mad Dash gives you full control over your horizontal movement, demanding a more deliberate and skillful approach to navigation. The standout feature is the Rage meter, which fills as you successfully chain dashes and narrowly avoid traps. Once full, you can unleash a 'Rage Mode'—a brief period of invincibility and speed that lets you smash through certain barriers and bypass tricky sections. This adds a layer of risk-reward: do you play it safe, or do you perform risky maneuvers to build Rage for an upcoming challenge? This, combined with intricate, maze-like levels that often feature secret paths and shortcuts, makes Mad Dash more than just a linear test of reflexes. It's about mastering a powerful character and outsmarting the labyrinth itself.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Mad Dash available on mobile or just PC?

Mad Dash is primarily a browser-based game, playable on most modern desktop web browsers. The developers, Liminal Creations, have also released official versions for both iOS and Android, featuring optimized touch controls for on-the-go play.

### How difficult is Mad Dash for a new player?

The game is designed to be challenging. While the initial levels gently introduce the core mechanics, the difficulty curve is steep. It's a 'tough but fair' experience that rewards persistence and pattern recognition. If you enjoy games that push your skills to the limit, you'll feel right at home.

### Does Mad Dash have multiplayer or leaderboards?

Mad Dash is a single-player experience focused on self-improvement. However, it features competitive global leaderboards for each level, tracking the fastest completion times. You can also race against the 'ghosts' of other players to see their winning routes and improve your own.

### I'm stuck on the dash timing. Any tips?

The key is to think of the dash as a separate action, not a double-jump. Jump first, and at the peak of your arc, press the jump button again. The timing feels more consistent at the height of your jump. Practice in the first level by simply jumping and dashing back and forth to build muscle memory.
