Get dropped anywhere in the world. Use your detective skills to figure out where you are in this ultimate geography challenge. How close can you get?

## What is GeoGuessr?

Welcome to GeoGuessr, the geography game that puts you anywhere in the world and asks one simple question: “Where are you?” Using Google Street View, this browser and mobile puzzle game drops you in a random location, from a bustling Tokyo intersection to a remote road in the Argentinian highlands. Your mission is to explore your 360° surroundings, hunt for clues, and pinpoint your location on a world map. The closer your guess, the more points you score. Originally a casual discovery game, GeoGuessr has evolved into a vibrant competitive scene. It’s perfect for geography buffs, curious explorers, puzzle solvers, and anyone who loves a good detective challenge. Whether you're playing solo to beat your own high score or battling others in real-time, GeoGuessr turns the entire planet into your personal playground. Ready to test your world knowledge and observation skills?

## How to Play GeoGuessr?

Your GeoGuessr journey begins the moment you're dropped into a random panorama. Use your mouse to click and drag to look around in 360 degrees. Click the arrows on the ground to move along roads and paths, and use your scroll wheel to zoom in on potential clues. The core of the game is investigation. Look for anything that can hint at your location: language on signs, unique license plates, domain names on websites advertised on vans, flags, architectural styles, and even the type of vegetation. A massive clue is the side of the road cars are driving on! Once you have a theory, open the map interface, navigate to where you think you are, and place your pin. Click the 'Guess' button to lock it in. You'll be shown the actual location and how far your guess was. In a classic game, you play five rounds, earning up to 5,000 points per round based on proximity. A perfect score is 25,000. For beginners, start with a map of a country you're familiar with to learn its specific clues before tackling the entire world.

## What Makes GeoGuessr Special?

GeoGuessr stands apart by turning the real world into an infinite puzzle box. Unlike games with designed levels, every session is unique, drawing from billions of Street View images. What truly makes it special today are its thrilling competitive modes. 'Battle Royale' pits you against other players in a fast-paced knockout format where you must guess the correct country to survive each round. 'Duels' offers an intense 1v1 challenge where you go head-to-head on the same locations, with points awarded for closer guesses. This transforms a relaxing solo activity into a high-stakes esport. Players love the deep 'meta-game'—learning to identify countries by their specific road markings, utility poles ('bollards'), or even the generation of the Google camera car used. It’s a game of constant learning and discovery, backed by a passionate community that creates thousands of custom maps, from 'Famous Movie Locations' to 'Airports of the World'.

### What's the best tip for getting a high score?

Learn the 'meta'. Beyond obvious clues like language, focus on subtle details. For example, different countries have unique road lines, utility poles, and license plate styles.
