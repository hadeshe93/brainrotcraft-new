## How to Play Vex 9?

Mastering Vex 9 is all about precision control and quick thinking. Get a handle on the fundamentals, and you'll be navigating deadly mazes like a pro.

**Controls:**

- **WASD / Arrow Keys:** Move your stickman left and right.
- **W / Up Arrow:** Jump.
- **S / Down Arrow:** Crouch or slide while running.
- **R Key:** Instantly restart from your last checkpoint.

**Core Mechanics:**
Your agility is your greatest asset. Jump against walls to perform a wall jump, allowing you to scale vertical shafts. Use the slide to duck under low obstacles or perform a long-distance slide-jump for clearing wide gaps. You'll also encounter special blocks: purple blocks launch you in a specific direction, while green blocks act as trampolines. Pay close attention to checkpoints (flags) – touching one saves your progress within a level.

**Progression & Beginner Tips:**
The game is structured into Acts. Simply complete one Act to unlock the next. For a true test of skill, try to collect all the stars in each level. **Beginner's Tip:** Don't rush! Take a moment to observe the patterns of traps before you leap. Master the slide-jump, as it's one of the most versatile moves for covering distance. Finally, don't be afraid to fail; hitting 'R' to quickly restart from a checkpoint is a core part of the learning process.

## What Makes Vex 9 Special?

The addition of a comprehensive Trophy system gives completionists tangible goals to strive for, from finishing levels without dying to collecting every star. It’s this combination of unforgiving design, rewarding mechanics, and deep replayability that keeps players coming back for one more try.
