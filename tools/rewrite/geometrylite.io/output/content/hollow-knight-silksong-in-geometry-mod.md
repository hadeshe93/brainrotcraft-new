## How to Play Hollow Knight: Silksong in Geometry Mod!?

Mastering your creative workshop is simple. The screen is your canvas, and a selection panel on the side holds all your tools.

**Basic Controls & Creation:**

- **Spawn Items:** Browse the side panel to find characters like Hornet and the Knight, enemies, weapons, and scenery. Click an item, then click on the main game board to place it.
- **Manipulate Objects:** Once placed, you have full control. Left-click and hold on any object to drag and move it around the scene. Use the context menu (often by right-clicking or using a dedicated UI button) to access options like resizing, rotating, or flipping objects to get the perfect angle.
- **Clean Up:** Made a mistake or want to start over? Activate the trash can tool from the menu, then simply click on any object you wish to remove.

**Game Mechanics & Progression:**
Characters aren't just static dolls; many have basic AI that allows them to walk and attack, bringing your scenes to life. The physics engine governs how everything interacts, creating dynamic and often unpredictable results. To expand your creative arsenal, you'll need crystals. Earn these by simply playing the game and leveling up your user profile. These crystals are your key to unlocking rare characters, powerful items, and special tools, rewarding your continued experimentation.

**Beginner's Tip:** Start small! Try recreating a familiar scene, like the Knight resting on a bench in Dirtmouth. Then, escalate by spawning a few enemies to see how they interact. Experimentation is the heart of the game.
