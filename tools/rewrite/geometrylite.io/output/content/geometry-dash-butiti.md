## How to Play Geometry Dash BuTiTi?

Mastering BuTiTi is all about rhythm and reflexes. The core control is simple: a single tap or click. However, the action changes depending on your form. As the cube, tap to jump. As the ship or UFO, tap or hold to fly upwards against gravity. As the ball, a tap instantly switches your gravity. For the wave, hold to move diagonally up and release to move diagonally down. The level scrolls automatically, and your goal is to reach the end (100%) without crashing. Success hinges on timing your actions to interact with jump pads, orbs, and portals correctly. For new players, Practice Mode is your best friend. It allows you to place checkpoints manually, so you can rehearse difficult sections without starting over. Focus on the transitions between forms, as BuTiTi is known for its seamless but quick changes. A key tip is to internalize the music; JonathanGD designed the level so that the beat of "Milkshake" is your best guide for when to tap. Look ahead, learn the rhythm, and conquer this masterpiece one section at a time.
