Descend into the abyss with Tartarus, the legendary Extreme Demon that once reigned supreme. Do you have the god-like skill to conquer this hellish masterpiece?

## What is Geometry Dash Tartarus?

Tartarus is a user-created level within the rhythm-based platformer Geometry Dash, and it stands as a monument to extreme difficulty. Categorized as an 'Extreme Demon,' it is not a standalone game but an infamous challenge crafted for the most elite players. Your objective is simple yet near-impossible: navigate your icon through a 2-minute, 20-second gauntlet of relentless obstacles synchronized to the intense track 'The Cosmos' by Dunderpatrullen. Hosted by Riot, Tartarus is a 'megacollab'—a masterpiece of level design forged by a team of legendary creators. It held the coveted #1 spot on the Demonlist for 262 days, a testament to its brutal difficulty. This level is designed for veteran players on PC who seek to push their skills to the absolute limit and etch their name into Geometry Dash history.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Tartarus?

While Geometry Dash is known for its one-button controls (click, tap, or press the spacebar to jump), Tartarus elevates this simple input to an art form. Every click must be executed with frame-perfect precision. You'll switch between various game modes, each demanding a unique control style: hold to fly the ship and wave through impossibly tight corridors, tap rhythmically to navigate the UFO, and execute perfectly timed jumps with the cube and robot. 

Success in Tartarus is a game of endurance and muscle memory. There is no progression system other than your own skill. The only way to beat it is in a single, perfect run from 0% to 100%. To get there, you must use 'Practice Mode' extensively to learn the patterns. Most serious players download a 'copyable' version of the level to place start positions, allowing them to drill individual sections relentlessly. 

A key tip for aspiring conquerors is to use a high-refresh-rate monitor (144Hz or higher), as the level's timings are built around high-precision physics. Study runs from top players to understand the subtle inputs, and practice the treacherous final 20% of the level first. Conquering Tartarus is a marathon that requires thousands of attempts and unbreakable mental fortitude.

## What Makes Geometry Dash Tartarus Special?

Tartarus's legacy is what makes it truly special. For nearly a year, it was the undisputed king of difficulty, the final boss of Geometry Dash that only a handful of players worldwide could defeat. Beating it remains a legendary benchmark of skill.

Unlike many collabs, Tartarus maintains a stunningly cohesive and menacing 'hell' theme, with a consistent dark red and black color palette that creates an oppressive, high-stakes atmosphere. Its gameplay is infamous for its focus on raw, unforgiving precision, especially in its tight wave and straight-fly ship sections. 

Finally, the level is structured like a dramatic performance. The difficulty ramps up to a legendary final section, a 'final boss' that tests not only a player's skill but their nerves under immense pressure. This combination of history, brutal but fair design, and thematic intensity is why players both fear and revere Tartarus.
