## How to Play Slope?

Getting started in Slope is simple, but mastering it is a true test of skill. Your ball begins rolling automatically down a 3D track, and your mission is to guide it for as long as possible.

**Controls:**
*   **Steer Left:** Left Arrow Key or 'A' Key
*   **Steer Right:** Right Arrow Key or 'D' Key

That's it! The controls are intentionally minimal to put the focus purely on your reflexes.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your ball constantly accelerates. The track is composed of green blocks, but you must avoid touching the red blocks at all costs—they will instantly end your run. The path is narrow and will twist, turn, and drop unexpectedly. Hitting ramps will launch you into the air, adding another layer of challenge. Your run ends if you collide with a red obstacle or fall off the track into the abyss below. Your score is directly tied to the distance you travel, so every second counts.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Subtle Movements:** Avoid sharp, jerky turns. Make small, precise adjustments to stay on course.
*   **Look Ahead:** Don't just focus on the ball. Scan the track ahead to anticipate upcoming turns and obstacles.
*   **Stay Centered:** Whenever possible, try to keep your ball near the center of the path to give yourself more room to react.

## What Makes Slope Special?

While many games offer endless running, Slope stands out with its pure, unadulterated focus on skill and speed. Its most defining feature is the procedurally generated world; no two runs are ever the same, guaranteeing infinite replayability and a fresh challenge every time you play. Unlike other runners, Slope features no power-ups, coins, or character unlocks. Success is based entirely on your reaction time and precision control. This purity is what players love—it’s a true test of a gamer's ability. The minimalist neon wireframe aesthetic is not just stylish; it creates a distraction-free environment, allowing you to focus solely on the path ahead. The relentless acceleration and physics-based movement combine to deliver a genuine adrenaline rush, making the chase for a new high score incredibly addictive and satisfying. It’s a simple concept executed to thrilling perfection.
