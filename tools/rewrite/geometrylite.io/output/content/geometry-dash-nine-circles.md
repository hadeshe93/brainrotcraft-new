## What is Geometry Dash Nine Circles?

Geometry Dash Nine Circles is not just a level; it's a legendary rite of passage within the Geometry Dash community. Originally a user-created level by Zobros, its immense popularity has led to its recreation as a standalone web-based challenge.

However, Nine Circles is infamous for its long, incredibly fast, and visually intense 'wave' section, which features a signature flashing color effect designed to disorient even the most seasoned players. This level is targeted at experienced Geometry Dash enthusiasts who are looking to test their skills against one of the most influential and challenging levels ever created.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Nine Circles?

Mastering Nine Circles is a true test of precision and endurance. The controls are simple, but the execution is anything but.

**Basic Controls:**
- **PC:** Use the `Spacebar`, `Up Arrow`, or `Left Mouse Button` to interact.
- **Action:** A single press or click causes your icon to jump or change its movement, depending on the current game mode.

**Game Mechanics & Level Structure:**
Nine Circles is primarily a test of your wave skills. The level progresses through distinct phases:
1.  **Cube Section (0-11%):** A relatively simple introduction. Click to make your cube jump over spikes and obstacles.
2.  **Ship Section (12-21%):** Hold to fly upwards and release to descend. Navigate through a tight but straightforward corridor.
3.  **The Wave Section (22-81%):** This is the core of the level. Your icon transforms into a wave. Hold to move diagonally up and release to move diagonally down. You must navigate incredibly narrow, fast-paced corridors with flashing, pulsating colors designed to break your focus. The speed changes multiple times, increasing the difficulty.
4.  **Final Cube Section (82-100%):** A much easier cube section allows you to catch your breath before the finish line.

**Beginner Tips:**
- **Abuse Practice Mode:** You will not beat this level without it. Use practice mode to place checkpoints and master each segment of the wave section individually.
- **Small, Precise Clicks:** During the wave, avoid holding for too long. Use short, precise taps to maintain control and navigate the tight spaces.
- **Look Ahead:** Try to look ahead of your icon instead of directly at it. This helps you anticipate upcoming patterns through the disorienting visual effects.
