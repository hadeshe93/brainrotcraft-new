Unleash your creativity in a new dimension! Build, share, and conquer mind-bending 3D levels in this fan-made evolution of the classic rhythm-platformer.

## What is Geometry Dash 3D: Build a level?

Geometry Dash 3D: Build a Level is a fan-made masterpiece that brilliantly reimagines the iconic rhythm-platformer in a fully three-dimensional space. Developed by Quix, this web-based game shifts the classic 2D side-scrolling action into a dynamic 3D world, offering a fresh perspective and a new layer of challenge. The game is a creative sandbox at its core, built around two main pillars: building and playing. Your primary objective is to use the intuitive level editor to design your own intricate, challenging, or visually stunning stages. Then, you can test your own creations or jump into an endless library of levels crafted by a global community of players. Designed for both veterans of the original series and creative newcomers, Geometry Dash 3D is perfect for anyone who has ever wanted to not just beat the level, but to be the architect behind the madness.

## How to Play Geometry Dash 3D: Build a level?

Mastering Geometry Dash 3D means getting comfortable in its two distinct modes: Play Mode and Build Mode.

**Play Mode - Conquer the Challenge**
This is where your reflexes are tested. The goal is to navigate your cube to the end of the level by avoiding obstacles.

- **Controls**: Use the **Spacebar** or a **Left Mouse Click** to jump. The timing is just as critical as in the original, but now you must also account for 3D space.
- **Mechanics**: Judge distances and alignments in a 3D environment. Use shadows and perspective to time your jumps over spikes, pits, and other hazards. The feeling is familiar, but the gameplay is entirely new.

**Build Mode - Unleash Your Creativity**
This is your canvas. Craft levels ranging from simple obstacle courses to complex, artistic worlds.

- **Camera Controls**: Move the camera with **WASD** or the **Arrow Keys**. Hold the **Right Mouse Button** and drag to rotate your view and build from any angle.
- **Building**: Select blocks, spikes, jump pads, and other elements from the menu. **Left-click** on the grid to place an object. You can easily switch, rotate, and delete objects to perfect your design.

**Beginner Tips**:

1.  **Start Small**: Build a short, simple level first to learn the editor's controls.
2.  **Test Constantly**: Use the instant 'Test' feature to play your level as you build. This helps you fine-tune difficulty and flow.
3.  **Study Others**: Play levels made by other players to get inspiration for new traps and design ideas.
4.  **Use Shadows**: In Play Mode, your cube's shadow is your best friend for judging your position above platforms.

## What Makes Geometry Dash 3D: Build a level Special?

Geometry Dash 3D stands out by taking a beloved 2D formula and giving it a whole new axis of gameplay. Its most unique feature is the full transition to 3D, which isn't just a visual gimmick—it fundamentally transforms the experience. Unlike the original, success now depends on spatial awareness and depth perception, adding a fresh layer of skill for even veteran players to master.

The true heart of the game, however, is its incredibly robust and accessible level editor. Where other games might have a limited builder, this game hands you the keys to the kingdom, empowering you to create challenges as complex and devious as anything in the official series. This focus on user-generated content creates infinite replayability. The game is a testament to fan passion, capturing the challenging spirit of Geometry Dash while pushing it in a bold, new, and creative direction that the community has embraced.

### Is this game harder than the original Geometry Dash?

### Can I play Geometry Dash 3D on my phone?

Geometry Dash 3D is primarily designed as a web-based game to be played on a PC or Mac with a keyboard and mouse. While it might load on a mobile browser, the controls are not optimized for touchscreens, and performance may be poor. For the best experience, play on a desktop.

### How do I share my levels with friends?

After building and testing your level, there is typically an option to generate a unique level code or link. You can copy this code and share it with friends, who can then import it into their game to play your creation. This is the core multiplayer aspect of the game.
