Race against rivals in a gravity-defying twist on Geometry Dash! Switch lanes, dodge spikes, and boost your way to victory in this high-speed, rhythm-based challenge.

## What is Geometry Dash: Mad Race?

Geometry Dash: Mad Race is a fan-made, arcade-style racing game that injects a shot of competitive adrenaline into the classic Geometry Dash formula. Available as a web-browser game, it pits you against a field of AI opponents in a frantic dash to the finish line. Your main objective isn't just to survive the treacherous, neon-lit tracks, but to outpace everyone else and claim first place. This spin-off is built for players who love the rhythm-based platforming of the original but crave a direct competitive element. Instead of just jumping, the core mechanic revolves around switching gravity, forcing you to navigate between the floor and ceiling to avoid obstacles and find the fastest route. With its vibrant geometric aesthetic and heart-pounding soundtrack, Mad Race offers an instantly accessible yet challenging experience for both Geometry Dash veterans and newcomers looking for a fast-paced test of reflexes.

## How to Play Geometry Dash: Mad Race?

Get ready to race! Your goal in Geometry Dash: Mad Race is to finish each level in first place. Unlike traditional Geometry Dash, your primary control is not a jump, but a gravity switch.

**Controls:**

- Press `[Spacebar]`, `[Up Arrow]`, or `[Left Mouse Button]` to instantly flip your cube to the opposite lane (from floor to ceiling, or ceiling to floor).

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- **The Race:** You are on the track with several AI-controlled cubes. Your position in the race is displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Obstacles:** Hitting any obstacle, like a spike or wall, will instantly destroy your cube and respawn you at the last checkpoint. This costs precious time and will likely cause you to lose positions.
- **Track Elements:** Look for green speed-boost arrows on the track. Hitting them will give you a temporary burst of speed, which is crucial for overtaking opponents or recovering from a mistake.

**Progression & Tips:**

- The game features five levels, each more complex and faster than the last.
- Success depends on rhythm and pattern recognition. Play a level multiple times to memorize the layout and anticipate the required gravity switches.
- Don't just react; think ahead. The key to winning is maintaining momentum and executing a smooth, error-free run. Practice timing your switches to flow through sections without hesitation.

## What Makes Geometry Dash: Mad Race Special?

What sets Geometry Dash: Mad Race apart is its brilliant transformation of a solo survival game into a competitive racer. The standout feature is the race itself; seeing other cubes on the track alongside you creates a dynamic and thrilling pressure that the original game's solo runs can't replicate. It feels less like a platformer and more like a futuristic, high-stakes sprint.

The core mechanic of gravity-switching, rather than simple jumping, also gives the game a unique identity. It forces a different kind of spatial awareness as you constantly analyze two paths simultaneously. This creates a compelling strategic layer: do you switch early to avoid a hazard, or hold your line to hit a speed boost? Mad Race delivers the addictive, single-player thrill of a multiplayer race, providing a consistent AI challenge that makes every attempt to get first place feel rewarding and earned. It’s the perfect blend of familiar Geometry Dash charm and fresh, competitive gameplay.
