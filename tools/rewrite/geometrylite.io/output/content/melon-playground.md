Unleash your imagination in a 2D physics sandbox! Build, experiment, and create chaotic scenes with a vast arsenal of items and ragdoll characters.

## What is Melon Playground?

Melon Playground is a wildly popular 2D physics sandbox game available primarily on mobile devices (iOS and Android). Inspired by games like People Playground, it hands you a digital toybox with one simple rule: do whatever you want. There are no scores, time limits, or missions. Your main objective is to explore your creativity and the limits of the game's physics engine. Spawn a cast of living ragdoll characters—like Melons, Corn, and Robots—and an ever-expanding arsenal of objects, including weapons, furniture, vehicles, and bizarre contraptions. Whether you're a budding storyteller creating elaborate scenes, an engineer building complex machines, or just someone who wants to see what happens when a melon meets a rocket launcher, the game offers limitless possibilities. It's the ultimate casual sandbox for players who love to experiment, build, and orchestrate creative chaos.

## How to Play Melon Playground?

Getting started in Melon Playground is simple, with controls designed for a touch interface. On the left side of your screen, you'll find the spawn menu, categorized into characters, melee weapons, firearms, explosives, and more. Simply tap a category and drag an item into the play area. You can pan your view by dragging with one finger and zoom in or out using two-finger pinch gestures. Tap on any object or character to select it. A context menu will appear on the right, allowing you to activate its function (like firing a gun), freeze it in place, resize it, or connect it to other objects with wires and ropes. A key mechanic is the time control button at the top of the screen. Tap it to pause the simulation, allowing you to perfectly arrange characters and items for your scene. Once you're ready, tap it again to watch the physics-driven action unfold.

**Beginner Tips:**

- Always pause the game before setting up a complex scene to ensure perfect placement.
- Experiment with the different wires and connections in the 'Mechanics' tab to build your own contraptions.
- You can save your favorite creations and scenes as 'Saves' to use them again later.
- Explore the modding community to download an endless supply of new items and characters.

## What Makes Melon Playground Special?

What sets Melon Playground apart is its incredible accessibility and depth, all packed into a free-to-play mobile experience. While inspired by PC physics sandboxes, it streamlines the controls for touchscreens, making it easy for anyone to jump in and start creating. The true magic lies in the complete freedom it offers. There are no rules or goals, empowering you to be a storyteller, an engineer, or simply an agent of chaos. Players love the surprisingly robust physics engine that leads to hilarious and unexpected outcomes. The ability to build, save, and share complex contraptions—from cars to elaborate destruction machines—provides endless replayability. But the game's biggest strength is its thriving modding community. With a constant stream of user-created characters, weapons, and props, the playground is always expanding, ensuring you'll never run out of new toys to experiment with.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Melon Playground available on PC?

Melon Playground is officially designed as a mobile game for iOS and Android devices. While you might find unofficial web versions or be able to play it on a PC using an Android emulator, the intended and fully supported experience is on your phone or tablet. This ensures the controls and performance are optimized for a touch interface.

### Can I play Melon Playground with friends?

Currently, Melon Playground is a strictly single-player experience. There is no built-in multiplayer mode. The game is designed as a personal sandbox for you to build, experiment, and create in your own world. You can, however, share videos of your creations or download contraptions made by other players to use in your game.

### How do I install mods in Melon Playground?

Installing mods adds endless variety. First, download mod files (usually `.melmod` or `.melsave`) from community sites. On Android, use a file manager to move the downloaded files into the 'Mods' or 'Saves' folder within the Melon Playground data directory. On iOS, the process may be more restricted, often requiring the 'Share to' function from the file. The exact steps can vary, so it's best to follow instructions from the mod's source.

### Is Melon Playground hard to learn?

Not at all! Melon Playground has a very low barrier to entry. The basic controls of spawning items and watching them interact are incredibly simple and intuitive. The 'difficulty' is entirely self-imposed. While making a simple scene is easy for anyone, designing and building complex, functioning machines can be a rewarding challenge for more advanced players. It's as easy or as complex as you want it to be.
