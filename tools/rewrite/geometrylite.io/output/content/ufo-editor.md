It strips away the complexity of the full editor, offering a streamlined, accessible toolset perfect for both aspiring creators and seasoned players who want to quickly prototype and share their wildest UFO challenges. Your imagination is the only limit as you design, test, and perfect the ultimate aerial obstacle course.

## How to Play UFO Editor?

Mastering UFO Editor is all about creativity and experimentation. The game is split into two main phases: Designing and Playing.

**Controls:**

- **In-Game (Playing):** Control your UFO with a simple click. Use your **mouse button, spacebar, or tap the screen** to give the UFO a short upward boost. Repeated, timed clicks are key to navigating tight spaces.
- **Editor Mode:** The editor is fully mouse-driven. Select objects like blocks, spikes, and saws from the toolbar. Click on the grid to place them. You can easily select, move, or delete objects to refine your design.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your goal is to build a playable level from start to finish. The magic lies in the special portals. Place **speed portals** to drastically alter the pace, forcing quick reactions. Use **gravity portals** to flip the entire level upside down, and employ **size portals** to shrink the UFO, changing its physics and allowing it to pass through narrow gaps. Once you've placed your objects, hit the **Play button** to instantly test your creation.

**Beginner's Tips:**
Start small. Build a short section with basic jumps to understand the UFO's arc. Then, introduce a single portal, like a speed change, to see how it feels. Don't be afraid to build "impossible" sections and then tweak them until they're challenging but fair. Frequent playtesting is the best way to turn a chaotic idea into a masterpiece.

## What Makes UFO Editor Special?

UFO Editor stands out by laser-focusing on one of Geometry Dash's most dynamic game modes. While the official game offers a complex, all-encompassing editor, UFO Editor provides a streamlined and accessible creative suite. There's no steep learning curve; you can jump right in and start building. This focus is its greatest strength. It allows you to explore the full potential of the UFO's unique, floaty physics without the distraction of other game modes. The instant-swap between building and playtesting creates a seamless and addictive design loop. Players love the pure creative freedom it offers—you can build a slow, precise puzzle or a chaotic, high-speed nightmare. The ability to easily share your levels using codes transforms it from a personal sandbox into a community-driven platform for endless, user-generated challenges.
