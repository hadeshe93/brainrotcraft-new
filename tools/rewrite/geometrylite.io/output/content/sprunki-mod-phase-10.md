Unleash your inner DJ with Sprunki Mod Phase 10! Mix and match dark, glitchy beats, effects, and vocals to compose your own unique electronic anthems in this creative music sandbox.

## What is Sprunki Mod Phase 10?

Sprunki Mod Phase 10 is a popular, fan-made music creation game inspired by the hit title Incredibox. It's a free-to-play, browser-based sandbox experience where you become the composer. You're given a crew of blank-slate characters and a palette of 20 unique sound icons. Your main objective is to drag these icons onto the characters to make them produce sound loops, layering beats, effects, melodies, and vocals to build a complete track. While the immediate goal is creative expression, the deeper challenge lies in discovering the three hidden 'bonuses'—special animated music videos that unlock when you find specific combinations of sounds. With its distinct dark, digital-glitch aesthetic and electronic soundscape, Phase 10 is perfect for fans of Incredibox, aspiring music producers, and any casual player who loves to experiment with sound and solve creative puzzles.

## How to Play Sprunki Mod Phase 10?

Mastering Sprunki Mod Phase 10 is intuitive and fun. The game is controlled entirely with your mouse.

**Basic Controls:**
- **Add a Sound:** Drag one of the 20 sound icons from the bottom of the screen and drop it onto any of the characters. They will instantly don a unique outfit and begin looping their sound.
- **Remove a Sound:** Simply drag the icon off the character and back to the bottom palette.
- **Mute/Solo:** Click on a character to mute their sound. Click them again to unmute. This is great for isolating parts of your mix.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
The 20 sounds are divided into four color-coded categories: Beats (red), Effects (blue), Melodies (teal), and Voices (yellow). To build a compelling track, start by establishing a rhythm with one or two 'Beats'. Then, layer on 'Effects' for atmosphere, 'Melodies' for harmony, and 'Voices' for a catchy hook. 

**Finding the Bonuses:**
The ultimate challenge is to unlock the three animated bonuses. To do this, you must find the correct combination of sounds playing at the same time. Pay close attention to the visual designs on the icons—often, the icons that belong together share a similar artistic theme. Experiment by trying different groups of sounds until you stumble upon a combo that triggers a special cutscene. Once a bonus is unlocked, it's saved for that session, and you can continue searching for the next one.

## What Makes Sprunki Mod Phase 10 Special?

Sprunki Mod Phase 10 stands out from the official Incredibox series with its unique, fan-crafted identity. Its greatest strength is its specific theme: a dark, edgy, digital-glitch world. The 20 custom sounds are tailored to this aesthetic, featuring aggressive electronic beats, distorted synths, and robotic vocals that you won't find anywhere else. This gives players a completely different sonic toolkit to create with, appealing to fans of electronic, industrial, and cyberpunk-style music. Unlike the often whimsical official versions, Phase 10 offers a grittier, more intense vibe. Players love the challenge of deciphering the visual clues on the icons to unlock the slickly animated bonuses, which feel like a rewarding payoff for their creative experimentation. It’s the perfect blend of a music-making tool and a clever puzzle game, offering a fresh experience even for veteran Incredibox players.
