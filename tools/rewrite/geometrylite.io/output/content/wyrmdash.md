Master the skies as a dragon-riding princess! Dive and soar through treacherous landscapes in this thrilling, one-button physics-based race for survival and glory.

## What is Wyrmdash?

Wyrmdash is a fast-paced, 2D physics-based racing game where skill, timing, and momentum are the keys to victory. Originally created for the GMTK 2019 game jam, it brilliantly executes the theme 'Only One' by using a single button for its entire control scheme. You play as a fierce princess racing her dragon against other riders across beautifully crafted, treacherous landscapes. Your main objective is to finish each race in first place to unlock new, more challenging courses. The game is primarily a web-browser experience, perfect for players who love arcade-style challenges that are easy to learn but incredibly difficult to master. If you enjoy games like Tiny Wings or Dragon, Fly! but crave the thrill of competitive racing and light combat, Wyrmdash is your next obsession.

## How to Play Wyrmdash?

Wyrmdash is built around an elegant one-button control system. To play, simply **CLICK AND HOLD** the mouse button (or press and hold the spacebar) to make your dragon dive towards the ground. **RELEASE** the button to make your dragon flap its wings and soar upwards. The core mechanic is mastering momentum. You must time your dives to perfectly align with the downward slopes of hills. As you slide down a hill, you build up immense speed. Release the button at the very bottom of a valley to convert that speed into a powerful upward launch, sending you flying through the air. As you gain enough momentum, your dragon will automatically breathe fire, allowing you to blast through rock barriers and temporarily stun opponents. 

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Be Smooth:** Focus on creating long, smooth arcs. Frantic, short flaps will kill your speed.
*   **Timing is Everything:** Start your dive just before the peak of a hill and release right as you hit the lowest point of the valley.
*   **Use Opponents:** You can bounce off the heads of other dragons for a small boost, but be careful—a poorly timed landing can slow you down.

## What Makes Wyrmdash Special?

Wyrmdash stands out with its deceptively simple 'one-button' control scheme. This single input governs a deep, physics-based flight system that is immensely satisfying to master. Unlike similar 'swoop and soar' games, Wyrmdash isn't just about survival or distance; it's a full-blown race. The addition of AI opponents, destructible obstacles, and a fiery breath attack that triggers with speed adds a layer of aggressive strategy. Players love the 'just one more try' addictive loop, where each race is an opportunity to perfect your timing and shave seconds off your run. The combination of charming pixel art, a thrilling fantasy theme, and a high skill ceiling makes every victory feel earned and exhilarating. It’s a masterclass in minimalist design creating maximum fun.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I go faster in Wyrmdash?

Speed comes from momentum, not just flapping. Focus on timing your dives perfectly with the terrain. Click and hold to dive down slopes, and release at the bottom of a valley to launch into the air. The smoother your flight path and the better you use the hills, the faster you will go.

### Does Wyrmdash have a multiplayer mode?

Wyrmdash is a single-player experience where you compete against challenging computer-controlled (AI) opponents. There is no head-to-head online multiplayer mode. The challenge comes from mastering the physics to beat the AI on progressively harder tracks.

### Is Wyrmdash a difficult game?

It's easy to learn but challenging to master. The one-button control is simple for anyone to pick up, but winning races requires significant practice. Perfecting your timing and understanding the physics provides a rewarding learning curve for players who enjoy skill-based games.

### What platforms can I play Wyrmdash on?

Wyrmdash is primarily a browser-based game, widely available to play for free on game portals like itch.io. This means you can play it on most desktop computers (Windows, Mac, Linux) with a modern web browser. There is no official, dedicated mobile app for iOS or Android.

### How do I use the fire breath attack?

The fire breath is an automatic ability! Your dragon will breathe fire when you've built up enough speed and momentum from successful dives and swoops. Focus on mastering your flight, and you'll naturally gain the power to blast through obstacles and stun your rivals.
