Unleash cosmic chaos in Solar Smash, the ultimate planet destruction simulator. Wield an arsenal of devastating weapons to obliterate worlds and watch the stunning, physics-based devastation unfold.

## What is Solar Smash?

Solar Smash is a wildly popular planet destruction simulator developed by Paradyme Games, available for free on PC (Steam), iOS, and Android devices. It's less of a traditional game and more of a cosmic sandbox where your primary objective is to discover creative and spectacular ways to annihilate planets. There's no winning or losing, just pure, satisfying destruction. You are given control over a vast and imaginative arsenal, from nuclear missiles and asteroids to reality-bending black holes and giant space monsters. The game appeals to a broad audience, from casual players seeking a way to blow off steam to simulation fans who enjoy experimenting with physics-based cause and effect. Whether you have five minutes or an hour, Solar Smash offers a visually stunning and cathartic experience of wielding god-like power.

## How to Play Solar Smash?

Getting started in Solar Smash is incredibly intuitive. Your screen is dominated by a target planet, with your arsenal of weapons located in a menu on the right. 

**Basic Controls:**
- **Select a Weapon:** Tap the weapon icon from the right-side panel.
- **Aim & Fire:** Simply tap or click on the planet's surface where you want your weapon to strike.
- **Camera Control:** Use two fingers to pinch-to-zoom (or your mouse wheel) and drag with one finger (or click-and-drag) to rotate your view of the planet, allowing you to admire your handiwork from any angle.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your goal is to reduce the planet's population, tracked in the corner of the screen, to zero. Each weapon has a unique effect—lasers can be dragged to slice through the crust, UFOs will abduct the population, and black holes will slowly consume the entire planet. Don't forget the reset button at the top left to instantly start over with a fresh world.

**Progression & Tips for Beginners:**
The real progression in Solar Smash isn't linear; it's about discovery. You unlock secret planets and achievements by performing specific, often unusual, actions. 

- **Experiment Freely:** Try every weapon to see what it does. Combine different attacks for maximum chaos.
- **Hunt for Secrets:** Pay close attention to the achievements list. It often contains clues on how to unlock hidden planets like Donut Earth or the Gingerbread Man.
- **Think Outside the Box:** What happens if you use the healing missiles to restore the planet instead of destroying it? This kind of curiosity is key to unlocking content.

## What Makes Solar Smash Special?

Solar Smash stands out by offering pure, unadulterated sandbox freedom. Unlike structured games, its beauty lies in the absence of rules and timers. It’s a digital stress ball on a planetary scale, where the only goal is your own satisfaction. The game’s biggest draw is its robust system of secrets and 'cosmic Easter eggs.' Players are constantly driven to experiment, not just to destroy, but to discover the specific, often bizarre, methods required to unlock dozens of hidden planets. This puzzle-like element adds immense replayability. Furthermore, the sheer variety of the arsenal—ranging from scientifically plausible asteroids to fantastical space worms and celestial beings—ensures that destruction never gets boring. The addition of 'System Smash' mode, where you can orchestrate the collision of entire solar systems, elevates the scale from planetary to truly cosmic, making Solar Smash a uniquely satisfying and endlessly replayable experience.
