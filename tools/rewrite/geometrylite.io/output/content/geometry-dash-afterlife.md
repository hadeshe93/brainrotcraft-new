## What is Geometry Dash Afterlife?

Geometry Dash Afterlife is a celebrated user-created level by Nasgubb, rated 10-stars with a Normal difficulty. As the first stage in the prestigious Discord Gauntlet, it serves as a gateway to more advanced challenges. This rhythm-platformer level takes you on a symbolic journey from life to the afterlife, masterfully represented by a dramatic shift in art style. Your objective is to navigate your icon through a series of obstacles by jumping, flying, and dodging in perfect sync with the energetic track "Afterlife" by F-777. The level begins in a bright, serene world before plunging you into a dark, mysterious landscape. Afterlife is designed for intermediate players ready to test their skills on a Gauntlet level, as well as anyone who appreciates top-tier visual design and atmospheric storytelling within the Geometry Dash universe.

## How to Play Geometry Dash Afterlife?

Mastering Afterlife revolves around Geometry Dash's simple yet demanding one-touch controls: tap or click to jump, and hold to fly your ship or UFO. The level is a linear progression through various game modes, including cube, ship, ball, and UFO, each requiring precise timing.

The gameplay is split into two distinct halves. The first part is relatively calm, allowing you to get a feel for the rhythm in a brightly lit environment. Around the 50% mark, the music and visuals shift dramatically, plunging you into a darker world where the difficulty significantly increases. The timings become tighter, and the corridors for your ship and UFO narrow.

**Beginner Tips:**

- **Use Practice Mode:** Don't try to beat it in one go. Use Practice Mode to place checkpoints, especially after the 50% transition, to learn the tricky patterns in the second half.
- **Listen to the Music:** The obstacles are perfectly synced to F-777's track. Internalizing the beat will help you anticipate jumps and transitions instinctively.
- **Coin Hunting Requires Exploration:** The three collectible coins are hidden off the main path. Finding them requires you to take risks and explore alternate routes, adding a layer of replayability.
