Think you're a master detective? Put your logic to the test in Who Is?, a hilarious puzzle game where you solve tricky riddles by interacting directly with each crazy scenario.

## What is Who Is?

Who Is? Brain Teaser & Riddles is an addictive and clever puzzle game developed by Unico Studio, available on iOS, Android, and web browsers. It challenges you to step into the shoes of a detective, a parent, or just a curious observer to solve a series of mind-bending scenarios. Each level presents a single question—like "Who is the imposter?", "Who is the mother?", or "Who is lying?"—and it's your job to find the answer. Unlike simple quiz games, Who Is? requires you to directly interact with the environment. You'll need to drag objects, uncover hidden items, and observe character reactions to find the crucial piece of evidence. The game is perfect for fans of brain teasers, logic puzzles, and escape room-style challenges who enjoy thinking outside the box. With its humorous art style and surprisingly creative solutions, it provides a satisfying mental workout for teens and adults alike.

## How to Play Who Is?

Mastering Who Is? is all about observation and interaction. Your primary tool is your finger on mobile or your mouse on the web. Each level is a self-contained puzzle with a clear question at the top.

**Core Mechanics:**
1.  **Analyze the Scene:** Carefully read the question and examine all the characters and objects on screen. Pay attention to small details.
2.  **Interact with Everything:** This is the key to success. Tap on characters to see their reactions. Drag items around—try moving a hat, opening a cabinet, or handing an object to a person. Swipe to reveal things hidden off-screen or behind other objects.
3.  **Use Your Inventory:** Some levels provide you with tools like scissors, a magnifying glass, or a bucket of water. Drag these tools onto different parts of the scene to trigger a reaction or reveal a clue.
4.  **Solve the Puzzle:** Once you've discovered the undeniable proof that answers the level's question, simply tap on the correct person or object to submit your answer and advance to the next challenge.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Think Literally:** Sometimes the clue is in the wording of the question itself. Try interacting with the text.
*   **Leave No Stone Unturned:** If you can tap it, drag it, or swipe it, you should. Many objects that seem like background decoration are actually interactive.
*   **Use Hints Wisely:** If you're truly stuck, you can use a hint (which usually requires watching an ad). It will point you in the right direction without giving away the entire solution.

## What Makes Who Is Special?

What sets Who Is? apart from other puzzle games is its hands-on, interactive approach to problem-solving. You aren't just a spectator choosing from multiple-choice answers; you are an active participant in the scene. Instead of guessing who is a vampire, you might have to drag the sun onto the screen to see who burns. This dynamic gameplay makes each solution feel earned and incredibly satisfying.

The game thrives on its creativity and humor. The puzzles are designed to subvert your expectations, forcing you to abandon conventional logic and think laterally. The solutions are often unexpected and genuinely funny, thanks to the charmingly simple art style and absurd scenarios. This combination of clever mechanics, a wide variety of puzzle types (from finding liars to solving mini-mysteries), and a consistent 'Aha!' factor makes Who Is? a standout title that keeps players engaged and entertained level after level.
