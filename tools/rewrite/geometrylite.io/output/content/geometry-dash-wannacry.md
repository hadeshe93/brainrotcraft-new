## What is Geometry Dash WANNACRY?

WANNACRY is a celebrated user-created level for Geometry Dash, masterfully crafted by kira9999. This isn't a separate game, but an electrifying in-game experience that secured 4th place in the prestigious NCS Gauntlet Contest. Themed around the infamous computer virus, WANNACRY thrusts you into a world of digital chaos and cybernetic threats. As a 10-star Medium Demon, it’s a rhythm-based platformer designed to test the reflexes and timing of seasoned players. Your objective is simple but brutal: navigate a 2-minute-and-11-second gauntlet of intricate obstacles, synchronized perfectly to NIVIRO’s haunting track, 'Annabelle’s Tea Party.' You'll control your icon through a series of fast-paced game modes, from reverse-gravity cubes to high-speed monster chases. If you're a Geometry Dash enthusiast seeking a level with stunning visuals, a compelling theme, and a balanced yet demanding challenge, WANNACRY is your next must-play.

## How to Play Geometry Dash WANNACRY?

Mastering WANNACRY requires precision, rhythm, and practice. The controls are classic Geometry Dash: a single input (mouse click, screen tap, or spacebar press) is all you have. The action this performs—jumping, flying, or switching gravity—changes depending on your current form (cube, ship, ball, etc.). Your goal is to survive from start to finish by timing your inputs to avoid crashing. The level begins with a disorienting reverse 3D cube section; try to focus on your icon's path rather than the confusing background movement. Soon, you'll enter massive swing tunnels with giant, flipping monitors, requiring consistent click patterns to navigate. A standout moment is the mini ball part, where you’ll need precise taps to guide a hacker icon breaking free from a shattered screen. For players new to this difficulty, Practice Mode is your best friend. Use it to place checkpoints and master each section individually. Pay close attention to the song, as its beat and melody often signal upcoming jumps. The climax is an intense, high-speed chase with blinding flashes and a terrifying glitch monster. This part is heavily reliant on memory, so rehearse it until the path is second nature.

## What Makes Geometry Dash WANNACRY Special?

WANNACRY stands out for its incredible thematic execution and visual storytelling. It's more than just a collection of obstacles; it's a narrative experience that brilliantly captures the feeling of a computer system under siege by a virus. You'll witness a hacker breaking free from a monitor, dodge corrupted data streams, and flee from a terrifying glitch monster in a high-stakes chase. The transitions are a highlight, especially a moment where the screen appears to shatter as you smash through a computer. This strong narrative is backed by award-winning design, earning the level 4th place in the NCS Gauntlet Contest. Creator kira9999 uses nearly 70,000 objects to build a dense, atmospheric world that feels alive and dangerous. Paired with the dark, driving beat of NIVIRO's 'Annabelle's Tea Party,' the experience is immersive and unforgettable. While challenging, players love that the gameplay feels fair and rewarding, making it a perfect benchmark for those looking to conquer Medium Demons.

## Frequently Asked Questions

It requires solid ship control, precise wave movements, and the ability to handle fast-paced, memory-based sections. It's challenging but fair for its rating.

### Where can I play Geometry Dash WANNACRY?

### Any tips for the final monster chase sequence?

The final chase is fast, flashy, and heavily based on memory. The best strategy is to use Practice Mode to learn the safe path. The monster's attacks and obstacle placements are always the same. Focus on your icon and the immediate path ahead, trying not to get distracted by the intense visual effects. Repetition is key to mastering this part.

### The level is lagging on my device. What can I do?

With nearly 70,000 objects, WANNACRY can be demanding on some devices. Check at the very beginning of the level for a Low Detail Mode (LDM) trigger, which can significantly improve performance. If none exists, try closing all background applications or playing on a more powerful device to reduce lag and ensure smoother gameplay.
