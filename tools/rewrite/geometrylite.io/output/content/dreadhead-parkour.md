## How to Play Dreadhead Parkour?

Mastering the urban landscape in Dreadhead Parkour is all about precise control and quick thinking. The controls are simple to learn but difficult to master, demanding perfect timing to survive.

**Core Controls:**
- **Up Arrow / X Key:** Press to perform a standard jump over obstacles and gaps.
- **Down Arrow:** Press to slide under low-hanging barriers and through tight spaces.
- **Right Arrow:** Hold this down to run and build momentum. You'll always want to be moving forward!

**Advanced Technique: The Glide**
To clear extra-wide gaps, you'll need to master the glide. After jumping, press and hold the Up Arrow again while in mid-air. This will extend your jump into a controlled glide, allowing you to cover much greater distances. Combine this with the Right Arrow to maintain forward momentum during your glide.

**Gameplay & Beginner Tips:**
1. **Always Look Ahead:** The game moves fast. Don't just focus on the immediate obstacle; try to scan a few steps ahead to anticipate what's coming next.
2. **Timing is Everything:** A jump that's too early or a slide that's too late will end your run instantly. Practice to get a feel for Dreadhead's movement and the exact timing required for each obstacle.
3. **Know When to Glide:** Not every jump requires a glide. Use the standard jump for smaller gaps and save the glide for the massive chasms that are impossible to cross otherwise. Using it unnecessarily can mess up your timing for the next obstacle.
