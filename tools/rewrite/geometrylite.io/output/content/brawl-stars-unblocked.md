## How to Play Brawl Stars Unblocked?

Mastering the arena is intuitive and fun! You control your Brawler's movement using the **WASD keys** on your keyboard. Aim your weapon with the **mouse cursor** and fire your primary attack by **left-clicking**. Some versions may feature special abilities or 'Supers' activated with the **Spacebar** or **right-click**.

Your gameplay journey follows a rewarding loop: fight, earn, and upgrade. Jump into the main game mode, typically a survival arena where you'll face relentless waves of enemies. Defeat them to complete missions and collect valuable coins and gems. These rewards are your key to progression. Head to the in-game shop to spend your earnings on Brawl Boxes. Each box contains a chance to unlock new Brawlers, power points for upgrades, or bonus currency.

**Beginner's Strategy:**
*   **Stay Mobile:** Never stand still! Constantly move to dodge incoming enemy fire. Circle-strafing around your foes is a key survival tactic.
*   **Prioritize Targets:** Focus your fire on weaker or more dangerous enemies first to thin the herd quickly and reduce incoming damage.
*   **Grind for Gold:** In your early matches, focus on surviving and collecting as many coins as possible. Your first few upgrades will significantly boost your survivability and damage output, making future runs much easier.
