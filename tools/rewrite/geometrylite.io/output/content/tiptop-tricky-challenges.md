## How to Play TipTop: Tricky Challenges?

Getting started in TipTop: Tricky Challenges is incredibly easy, as the controls are intuitive and entirely mouse-based. Each new level is a self-contained mini-game with a unique objective that will be briefly explained on screen.

**Core Controls & Mechanics:**
- **Action:** Most actions are performed with a simple mouse click, click-and-hold, or click-and-drag.
- **Examples:** For a bottle flip challenge, you'll click and drag to set the power and angle of your toss, then release. For a sorting puzzle, you'll click on different containers to pour their contents. For drawing or cutting challenges, you'll click and drag your cursor to create a line.

**Progression System:**
The game features over 100 levels that you unlock sequentially. Your performance on each level is rated with up to three stars. This rating is typically based on your accuracy, speed, or the number of attempts it takes to succeed. While you only need to pass a level to progress, true masters will want to go back and collect all three stars on every challenge.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Read Instructions:** Always pay attention to the quick instruction at the start of a new level. It tells you exactly what to do.
2.  **Precision Over Speed:** Many challenges reward a steady hand and careful planning more than frantic clicking.
3.  **Learn and Adapt:** Don't get discouraged if a new puzzle type seems tricky. Take a moment to understand the physics or logic, and don't be afraid to retry.
4.  **Steady Your Hand:** For any challenge involving drawing or cutting, use smooth, deliberate mouse movements for the best results.
