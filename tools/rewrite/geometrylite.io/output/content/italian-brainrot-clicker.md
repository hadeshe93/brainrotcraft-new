## How to Play Italian Brainrot Clicker?

Getting started with Italian Brainrot Clicker is as simple as the meme itself. The controls require nothing more than your mouse.

**Core Gameplay:**
Your primary action is to click the large character in the center of the screen. Each click earns you 'Brainrot' points, the game's main currency.

**Progression System:**
As your Brainrot balance grows, you can invest it in two key areas from the menu on the right:
1.  **Unlock Characters:** Spend points to unlock new, bizarre characters like Cappuccino Assassino, Burbaloni Luliloli, and Tralalero Tralala. Each character you unlock adds to the visual chaos and boosts your overall Brainrot generation rate.
2.  **Purchase Upgrades:** You can also buy powerful upgrades. 'Click Power' upgrades increase the amount of Brainrot you earn per manual click. 'Auto-Clicker' upgrades provide passive income, automatically generating Brainrot for you over time, even when you're not clicking. 

Your goal is to efficiently balance these upgrades to unlock all the characters and fill your screen with glorious, nonsensical meme madness.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Invest in Idle Power:** After buying your first few click power upgrades, save up for an auto-generator. This passive income is crucial for faster progress.
*   **Balance Your Spending:** Continuously compare the cost and benefit of upgrading your click power versus your idle generation. A balanced approach is often the most effective.
*   **Save for Characters:** While small upgrades are tempting, saving up for the next character unlock often provides the biggest jump in your earnings.
