## How to Play Crazy Chicken 3D?

Getting started in Crazy Chicken 3D is simple, but mastering the mayhem takes skill. Your objective is to knock every other chicken off the platform.

**Controls:**
*   **Move:** Use the **WASD** keys or the **Arrow Keys** to navigate your chicken around the arena.

**Core Mechanics:**
*   **Bumping:** The main way to attack is to ram into other chickens. The more momentum you have from a running start, the more powerful your push will be. A well-timed, high-speed bump can send an opponent flying off the edge.
*   **The Shrinking Arena:** Pay close attention to the platform! Over time, the outer tiles will fall away, reducing the play area and forcing everyone closer together. Use this to your advantage by trapping others, but be careful not to get caught on the crumbling edge yourself.
*   **Physics is King:** Every collision is governed by the game's physics engine. Bumping someone head-on is different from hitting them at an angle. Experiment to see how you can use glancing blows to spin opponents out of control or use their own momentum against them.

**Beginner's Tips:**
1.  **Stay Near the Center:** In the beginning, avoid the perilous edges. Let other players weaken each other while you maintain a safe position.
2.  **Pick Your Fights:** Don't charge into a massive brawl. Instead, look for isolated players near an edge who make for an easy target.
3.  **Bait and Switch:** Lure an aggressive player towards the edge, then quickly sidestep and push them from the side as they charge past you.

## What Makes Crazy Chicken 3D Special?

Crazy Chicken 3D stands out with its brilliant blend of simplicity and unadulterated chaos. Unlike other battle royales that bog you down with loot and complex abilities, this game is all about pure, physics-based skill. Winning depends entirely on your movement, positioning, and timing, making every victory feel earned and satisfying.

The instant-action format is a huge draw. Matches are quick and energetic, so you can jump in for a few rounds without a major time commitment. Whether you win or get hilariously flung into the void within seconds, you're always just one click away from the next match.

But the real magic is in its slapstick comedy. The wobbly animations, the frantic flapping of chickens trying to recover, and the unpredictable chain reactions from a single bump create moments of genuine laughter. It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, focusing on fun and accessible competition for everyone.
