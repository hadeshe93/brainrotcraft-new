## How to Play Traffic Rally?

Mastering the highway in Traffic Rally is all about precision and anticipation. Your car accelerates automatically, so your entire focus is on navigation. 

**Controls:**
- **Desktop:** Use the **Left/Right Arrow Keys** or **A/D Keys** to switch lanes.
- **Mobile:** Simply **tap** on the left or right side of the screen to steer your car into the adjacent lane.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
The core of the game is survival. You must dodge an endless stream of cars moving at different speeds. The farther you travel, the higher your score. As you progress, the traffic becomes faster and more congested, demanding quicker reflexes. Along the way, you'll find coins scattered across the lanes. Grab them without crashing to build up your wallet. These coins are crucial for the game's progression system, allowing you to head to the garage from the main menu and unlock a variety of new and cooler-looking vehicles to show off on your next run.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Look Ahead:** Don't just focus on the car directly in front of you. Scan two or three cars ahead to anticipate lane changes and open paths.
2.  **Stay Calm:** Avoid frantic, last-second lane switches. Smooth, planned movements are safer and more effective.
3.  **Survival Over Coins:** In a tight spot, always prioritize avoiding a crash over grabbing a few extra coins. A longer run will always yield a better score.

## What Makes Traffic Rally Special?

Traffic Rally stands out by stripping the racing genre down to its most thrilling element: high-speed dodging. Unlike racing simulators that require track memorization and complex car tuning, this game offers pure, unadulterated arcade fun. Its magic lies in its 'one more try' addictiveness. The simple controls make it instantly playable for everyone, but the escalating difficulty provides a deep challenge that keeps you coming back. Players love the zen-like focus required to achieve a high score, entering a flow state where every near-miss is a tiny victory. The progression system of unlocking new cars with collected coins adds a rewarding goal beyond just beating your last score, giving every run a purpose. It's the perfect game for when you have a few minutes to spare and want an immediate, satisfying test of skill.
