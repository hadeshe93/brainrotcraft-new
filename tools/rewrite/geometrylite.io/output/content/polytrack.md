Race against your own ghost in this stylish low-poly racer! Master the official tracks to unlock new cars, then build and share your own wild courses in the powerful track editor.

## What is PolyTrack?

PolyTrack is an addictive 3D time trial racing game that challenges you to a race against the most formidable opponent: yourself. Rendered in a sleek, low-poly art style, this browser-based game is all about precision, speed, and endless improvement. Your primary objective is to set the fastest possible lap times on a variety of pre-made tracks. Each time you complete a race, your best performance is saved as a 'ghost' car, creating a visual benchmark to beat on your next attempt. As you master the official courses and hit target times, you'll unlock a garage of new vehicles, each with unique handling and speed characteristics. Designed for players who love the thrill of shaving milliseconds off their record and those with a creative spark, PolyTrack offers a pure, skill-based racing experience. Whether you're a competitive speedrunner aiming for the top or a creative builder, there's a track waiting for your tires.

## How to Play PolyTrack?

Jumping into PolyTrack is simple and intuitive. From the main menu, you can choose 'Racing Mode' to tackle the official tracks or unleash your imagination in 'Track Design Mode'.

**Core Controls:**
*   **Accelerate/Brake:** W/S or Up/Down Arrow keys
*   **Steer Left/Right:** A/D or Left/Right Arrow keys
*   **Restart Race:** R key

In Racing Mode, your goal is to complete the track as fast as possible. Your first lap sets a baseline. Afterward, you'll see a translucent 'ghost' car of your best run racing alongside you, providing a real-time visual guide to where you can gain or lose time. The game's progression is tied to your performance. By beating certain time thresholds on each track (often bronze, silver, and gold), you'll unlock new, faster cars and gain access to more challenging courses.

**Track Design Mode:**
This mode gives you the tools to build your own dream circuit. You'll place down track nodes, adjust elevation, and create loops, jumps, and chicanes. Once you've created a closed circuit, you can save it and race on it immediately.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Focus on the Ghost:** Don't just race blindly. Watch your ghost to see which corners you handled well and where you can improve your racing line.
*   **Learn the Cars:** Each car has different acceleration and handling. Switch cars to find the best one for a particular track's layout.
*   **Smooth is Fast:** Avoid jerky movements. Try to maintain momentum through corners by braking early and accelerating out of the apex.

## What Makes PolyTrack Special?

While many racing games focus on competing against AI or other players, PolyTrack's genius lies in its pure focus on self-improvement. The 'ghost car' mechanic isn't just a feature; it's the core of the experience, turning every race into an addictive duel against your past self. This creates a perfect, frustration-free loop of 'just one more try' to shave off another fraction of a second.

The game's other standout feature is its incredibly deep and intuitive Track Editor. It transforms PolyTrack from a simple racing game into a limitless creative sandbox. Players can design, build, and test anything from a simple oval to a complex, gravity-defying rollercoaster of a track. This user-generated content gives the game near-infinite replayability. Combined with its clean, minimalist low-poly art style and tight, responsive controls, PolyTrack offers a uniquely focused and endlessly creative racing experience.
