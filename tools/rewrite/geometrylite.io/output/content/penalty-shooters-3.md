## How to Play Penalty Shooters 3?

Mastering Penalty Shooters 3 requires precision timing for both offense and defense. The controls are simple, but the mechanics have depth.

**Shooting (Offense):**
1.  **Aim & Power:** Click and hold your mouse button (or tap and hold on mobile). A target will move horizontally and vertically across the goal. At the same time, a power meter will fill up.
2.  **Shoot:** Release the button when the target is where you want to shoot and the power is at your desired level. Timing is everything!

**Goalkeeping (Defense):**
1.  **Anticipate:** As the opponent runs up to shoot, watch the goal closely.
2.  **React & Dive:** A red target will flash on the goal for a split second, indicating where the ball is going. Click (or tap) that target instantly to make your keeper dive and attempt a save.

**Progression & Tips:**
The game features two main modes: **Tier Challenge**, where you climb a ladder against increasingly difficult opponents, and **World Cup**, a classic tournament bracket. Winning matches earns you coins. Use these coins in the shop to upgrade your player's Shooting and Goalkeeping stats or to unlock new jerseys and cool fantasy players. 

*   **Beginner's Tip:** When shooting, don't always aim for the top corners. Vary your shots and power levels to keep the AI guessing. When goalkeeping, ignore the shooter's animation and focus solely on reacting to the red target.
