## How to Play Rooftop Snipers 2?

Mastering the art of the rooftop duel is all about timing and embracing the chaos. The controls are deceptively simple, but the physics engine adds a layer of hilarious difficulty.

**Controls:**
*   **Player 1:**
    *   **W Key:** Jump. Hold to jump higher.
    *   **E Key:** Shoot. Press to fire your weapon.
*   **Player 2:**
    *   **I Key:** Jump. Hold to jump higher.
    *   **O Key:** Shoot. Press to fire your weapon.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your goal is to knock your opponent off the platform to score a point. The first player to reach 5 points wins the match. Every action is governed by physics. Shooting creates a backward recoil, pushing you away from your target, so be careful not to fire yourself off the edge! Similarly, jumping requires you to manage your momentum to land safely. Some levels introduce different weapons, like tomahawks or powerful rifles, that you'll need to adapt to on the fly.

**Beginner Tips:**
*   **Patience is Key:** Don't just spam the shoot button. Wait for a clear shot when your opponent is near the edge.
*   **Dodge and Weave:** Use the jump button not just to get a better angle, but to actively dodge incoming fire.
*   **Use Your Recoil:** You can use the pushback from your shots to quickly move away from danger or reposition yourself.
*   **Stay Centered:** Try to stay near the middle of the rooftop to give yourself more room for error.

## What Makes Rooftop Snipers 2 Special?

With just two buttons per player, anyone can jump in and start playing immediately, making it the ultimate 'pick up and play' game for parties or a quick break. Unlike complex shooters, the focus here is on hilarious duels with a friend sitting right next to you. This emphasis on accessible, local 2-player competition is what makes it a timeless favorite.
