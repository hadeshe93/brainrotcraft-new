Experience a true Geometry Dash classic! Jump, fly, and roll through ReTraY, a legendary 2-star level perfectly synced to the unforgettable electronic track by Itro & Tobu.

## What is Geometry Dash ReTraY?

Geometry Dash ReTraY is a legendary user-created level that has become a cornerstone of the game's community. Created by the celebrated designer DiMaViKuLov26, this rhythm-based platformer is famous for its flawless synchronization with the hit song 'ReTraY' by Itro & Tobu. As a player, your objective is to navigate your icon through a series of geometric obstacles by jumping, flying, and changing gravity in time with the music. Although it's a level within the main Geometry Dash game, its immense popularity has led to it being featured on numerous web-based platforms, making it easily accessible. With an official 'Easy' 2-star difficulty rating, ReTraY is the perfect entry point for new players wanting to understand the core mechanics of the game. For veterans, it’s a nostalgic and satisfying experience that showcases the beauty of classic level design.

## How to Play Geometry Dash ReTraY?

Mastering ReTraY is all about rhythm and timing. The controls are deceptively simple: use a single action—a click, a screen tap, or pressing the spacebar/up arrow—to make your icon jump and interact with the world. The level will automatically transition you between different game modes, each with its own unique controls.

- **Cube Mode:** Your default form. A single click performs a jump. The height and distance depend on how long you hold the button before hitting a surface.
- **Ship Mode:** Click and hold to fly upwards; release to descend due to gravity. This mode requires smooth, controlled taps to navigate tight corridors.
- **Ball Mode:** A click instantly switches your gravity, causing you to roll along the ceiling or floor. Timing these swaps is key to navigating its puzzle-like sections.

Your primary goal is to reach the end of the level (100%). For an extra challenge, hunt for the three hidden user coins. 

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Trust the Music:** The level is synced to the beat. Listen closely, as the music often signals when you need to jump or act.
2.  **Use Practice Mode:** Don't be afraid to use Practice Mode to learn tricky sections without starting over. You can place checkpoints to master specific parts, especially the coin routes.
3.  **Coin Hunting:** The second coin at 31% is the hardest, requiring precise ship control. The third coin at 95% requires you to drop down instead of making an obvious jump.

## What Makes Geometry Dash ReTraY Special?

ReTraY stands out not for its extreme difficulty, but for its perfect execution and influential design. Its most celebrated feature is the **legendary music synchronization**. Every jump, portal transition, and visual pulse is meticulously timed to the beat of Itro & Tobu's track, creating an incredibly satisfying and immersive flow state. This level is often cited as a masterclass in how to build a level *around* a song.

Secondly, its **classic and clean design** by DiMaViKuLov26 is a hallmark of the 1.9 era. While simple by modern standards, its effective use of blocks, colors, and effects creates a polished experience that never feels cluttered. It proves that you don't need overwhelming effects to make a memorable level.

Finally, ReTraY is widely considered the **perfect introductory level**. It gently introduces players to the three core game modes (cube, ship, ball) in a low-pressure environment, making it an ideal starting point for anyone new to the Geometry Dash universe. Its combination of fun, fairness, and fantastic music is why it remains a beloved favorite.
