How far will you go for $25,000? In this dark satirical clicker, every click earns cash but inflicts pain. Test your morals and discover the grim price of survival.

## What is BLOODMONEY!?

BLOODMONEY! is a chilling and satirical take on the idle clicker genre, playable directly in your web browser. You're thrust into a desperate situation: you need $25,000 for a life-saving surgery, and a mysterious man named Harvey Harvington has a bizarre proposition. He'll let you click on him, earning you money with each tap, but every click causes him visible agony. This isn't about mindless grinding; it's a narrative-driven experience that explores themes of desperation, moral decay, and the disturbing ease of compromising one's values for personal gain. As your earnings grow, so does the temptation to use increasingly cruel 'upgrades' to speed up the process. Designed for players who appreciate psychological horror and games that pose difficult ethical questions, BLOODMONEY! forces you to confront the grim consequences of your greed. Your choices directly shape the story, leading to one of three distinct and impactful endings.

## How to Play BLOODMONEY!?

The gameplay in BLOODMONEY! is deceptively simple. Your primary action is to click on the character, Harvey, to earn money. You start by earning $1 per click with your bare hand. As you accumulate funds, a panel on the left allows you to purchase upgrades. These aren't typical power-ups; they are increasingly vicious tools. Buying the Feather boosts your income to $2 per click, the Needle to $4, and so on, culminating in the Gun, which nets you a brutal $20 per click. The core mechanic is a trade-off: faster income versus escalating cruelty. Harvey's reactions become more severe with each new tool, and the game's atmosphere darkens accordingly. Your goal is to reach $25,000.

**Beginner Tips:** Pay attention to the red button on the right side of the screen. Clicking it accelerates the process but has a severe negative impact on Harvey's well-being, pushing you toward the 'Bad Ending.' If you're aiming for the 'Good Ending,' exercise patience. Stick to the lower-tier upgrades like the feather and needle, and avoid buying the gun entirely. The game is a short, focused experience, so every upgrade choice you make significantly influences your final outcome.

## What Makes BLOODMONEY! Special?

BLOODMONEY! shatters the mold of traditional idle clickers. Instead of endless grinding for abstract numbers, it presents a finite, narrative-driven moral test. The game's genius lies in its upgrade system, where each 'improvement' is a tool of torture, forcing you to weigh your greed against your empathy. This creates a powerful psychological tension rarely seen in the genre. Unlike games focused on jump scares, its horror is entirely atmospheric and ethical, stemming from your own actions and their visible impact on Harvey. Players are captivated by this subversion of the clicker formula; it’s not about getting the highest score, but about discovering what choices you'll make under pressure. The three distinct endings, each a direct consequence of your playstyle, provide significant replay value and make BLOODMONEY! a short but unforgettable experience that sticks with you long after you've reached the $25,000 goal.
