Test your timing and precision in this minimalist arcade game. Your goal is simple: pin all the balls to a spinning core without a single collision. One mistake, and it's game over!

## What is Coreball?

Coreball is a captivating minimalist arcade game that strips gameplay down to its purest form: timing and precision. Available directly in your web browser, it's the perfect test of reflexes for players of all ages. The concept is brilliantly simple: you have a queue of numbered balls at the bottom of your screen and a rotating core at the center. Your objective is to launch each ball and attach it to the core. The catch? You must do so without hitting any of the other balls already orbiting the core. With its clean interface and straightforward goal, Coreball is incredibly easy to pick up but deceptively difficult to master. It’s designed for anyone seeking a quick, skill-based challenge that you can play in short bursts, whether you're on a coffee break or looking for an addictive puzzle to conquer.

## How to Play Coreball?

Mastering Coreball is all about rhythm and patience. The controls are as simple as it gets: just click your mouse or tap your screen to launch the next ball from your queue towards the central core.

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Objective:** Successfully attach all the balls from your queue to the rotating core.
- **The Challenge:** Your launched ball cannot collide with any other balls already attached to the core. If a collision occurs, the level instantly restarts.
- **Progression:** The game is structured in levels. You start with a few balls and a slowly rotating core. As you advance, the difficulty ramps up significantly. Expect more balls to attach, more pre-set obstacles on the core, and faster, more erratic rotation patterns.

**Beginner Tips to Succeed:**
1.  **Observe First, Act Second:** Don't rush your shots. Watch the core for a full rotation to understand its speed and pattern. Identify the largest gaps.
2.  **Find the Rhythm:** The core's rotation often has a steady beat. Try to internalize this rhythm and tap in sync with it to improve your accuracy.
3.  **Patience is a Virtue:** Sometimes the best move is to wait. A perfect opening will eventually appear. Firing into a tight space is a recipe for failure.
4.  **Aim Ahead:** On faster levels, you may need to 'lead' your shot by clicking just before the gap is perfectly aligned with your ball.

## What Makes Coreball Special?

In a world of complex games, Coreball's beauty lies in its radical simplicity. It has no story, no upgrades, and no flashy graphics. Its unique appeal comes from being a pure, unadulterated test of a single skill: precision timing. This minimalist design removes all distractions, allowing you to enter a state of deep focus where every click matters. The instant feedback of success or failure, combined with a one-second restart, creates a powerful and highly addictive 'just one more try' gameplay loop. Unlike other games, the satisfaction in Coreball doesn't come from a high score, but from the personal triumph of conquering a seemingly impossible level. It's a game that proves that the most engaging challenges don't need complexity, just a brilliant core mechanic.
