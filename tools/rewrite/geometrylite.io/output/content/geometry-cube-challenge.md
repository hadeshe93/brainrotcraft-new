## What is Geometry Cube: Challenge?

Geometry Cube: Challenge is a fast-paced, rhythm-action platformer that tests your timing, reflexes, and persistence. Playable directly in your web browser, this game drops you into a minimalist world of geometric obstacles and pulsating electronic music. You control a nimble cube that moves forward automatically, and your sole objective is to navigate it to the end of seven distinct, handcrafted levels. Each stage is a gauntlet of spikes, pits, and sawblades, all perfectly synchronized to the soundtrack. This game is designed for players who love a pure, skill-based challenge. If you're a fan of one-button games like Geometry Dash or are looking for an intense test of focus and precision, Geometry Cube: Challenge delivers a concentrated dose of addictive, high-stakes platforming action that will keep you coming back for 'just one more try'.

## How to Play Geometry Cube: Challenge?

The goal in Geometry Cube: Challenge is simple: survive. Your cube slides forward on its own, and your only job is to jump at the perfect moment to avoid crashing. 

**Controls:**
- **Jump:** Press the `Left Mouse Button`, `Spacebar`, or `tap the screen` on a touch device.
- **Continuous Jumps:** `Hold down` the jump button to perform a series of rapid, consecutive jumps, which is essential for navigating quick-step platforms or rows of spikes.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Progression is linear through 7 levels of increasing difficulty. A single mistake—hitting a spike, wall, or falling into a pit—sends you right back to the start of the level. There are no health bars or checkpoints. This unforgiving system is the core of the challenge, forcing you to memorize patterns and execute your jumps with flawless precision. Pay close attention to the level's layout and the rhythm of the music, as the beat often provides cues for when to jump.

**Beginner Tips:**
1.  **Learn the Rhythm:** Don't just watch the obstacles; listen to the music. The beat is your best guide for timing.
2.  **Master Tap vs. Hold:** Use short, quick taps for single-block hops and long holds to clear chains of obstacles or large gaps.
3.  **Embrace Failure:** You will crash hundreds of times. Every attempt is a learning experience that helps you memorize the next part of the level. Stay calm and persistent.
