## How to Play Grow a Garden?

Getting started in Grow a Garden is as easy as planting a seed! The entire game is controlled with your mouse or by tapping on your screen.

**Basic Controls & Mechanics:**
- **Planting:** Click on an empty garden plot to plant a seed.
- **Watering:** After planting, your crop will need water. Click on the plant to water it and start the growth timer.

- **Selling:** Take your harvested produce to the market stall and click to sell it for cash.

**Progression and Strategy:**
The core loop is simple: Plant, Water, Harvest, Sell, Repeat. Use the money you earn to visit the shop. Here, you can buy more of the seeds you've unlocked or save up to purchase new, more profitable types of crops like tomatoes, strawberries, and corn. As your farm grows, you can also buy more plots of land to expand your planting area. 

**Beginner Tips:**
