Start with a humble classic and work your way up to owning a fleet of legendary drift machines. With its realistic physics engine and focus on pure skill, Drift Hunters is designed for everyone from casual players looking for a fun driving experience to hardcore car enthusiasts who love the challenge of taming a high-horsepower beast and tuning it to perfection. It's all about the thrill of the slide.

## How to Play Drift Hunters?

Getting started in Drift Hunters is easy, but mastering it is a true challenge. Your goal is to drift for as long and as stylishly as possible to earn cash.

**Core Controls:**
- **W / Up Arrow:** Accelerate
- **S / Down Arrow:** Brake / Reverse
- **A / Left Arrow:** Steer Left
- **D / Right Arrow:** Steer Right
- **Spacebar:** Handbrake (Essential for initiating a drift)
- **C:** Change Camera View
- **Left Shift / Left Ctrl:** Shift Up / Shift Down (for manual transmission)

**Drifting Mechanics:**
The art of the drift is a balance of speed, angle, and throttle control. To start a drift, accelerate into a corner, turn sharply, and tap the **Spacebar** to kick the rear end of the car out. Immediately counter-steer (steer in the opposite direction of the slide) and use the **W** key to feather the throttle, maintaining your angle and momentum. The longer you hold a drift and the higher your angle, the more points you'll earn. Link drifts together to build a score multiplier.

**Progression & Tips:**
Use the cash you earn to buy new cars or visit the garage to upgrade your ride. You can upgrade the engine, turbo, gearbox, and more. For beginners, start with the initial Toyota AE86—it's low-power and easy to learn with. Practice on open tracks like 'Dock' or 'Touge' to get a feel for the physics before tackling more complex circuits. Don't be afraid to experiment with tuning settings like camber and brake balance to suit your style.

## What Makes Drift Hunters Special?

Drift Hunters stands out in a sea of racing games by focusing purely on the art of drifting and deep customization. What truly sets it apart is its incredibly detailed tuning system, a feature rarely seen in free browser games. You can fine-tune everything from brake balance and front/rear camber to ride height and wheel offset, allowing you to create a car that handles exactly how you want. 

The game also boasts a roster of over 25 cars, heavily inspired by real-world JDM and drift legends like the Nissan Silvia S15, Toyota Supra, and Mazda RX-7. Each car feels distinct thanks to a rewarding physics engine that accurately models weight, power, and your tuning adjustments. This combination of an iconic car list, a challenging yet satisfying physics model, and unparalleled customization makes Drift Hunters a beloved title for car enthusiasts who appreciate the technical skill and style of drifting.
