The classic playground game of tag, supercharged for online duels. Outrun and outsmart your opponent in a high-speed platforming chase where one touch ends the round!

## What is Tag 2?

Welcome to Tag 2, the sequel that cranks the adrenaline of the classic chase up to eleven. This is a fast-paced, 1v1 competitive action platformer where reflexes and strategy collide. Played in your browser, the concept is simple: one player is the Tagger (red), and the other is the Runner (blue). If you're the Runner, you must survive the round without being caught. If you're the Tagger, you have to close the distance and make contact before the timer runs out. Each round is a short, intense burst of parkour-style action across cleverly designed maps filled with bounce pads, tight corridors, and tricky jumps. Tag 2 builds on its predecessor with smoother movement physics, more dynamic levels, and tighter chase mechanics, making it the ultimate test of agility for players who love quick, skill-based competitive fun.

## How to Play Tag 2?

Mastering movement is the key to victory in Tag 2. The game pits you against another player in a series of short, timed rounds where your roles as Tagger and Runner will swap.

**Controls:**

- **Move:** A/D or Left/Right Arrow Keys
- **Jump:** W or Up Arrow Key
- **Dash:** Spacebar (after a short cooldown)

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
The core of the game is a high-stakes chase. As the **Runner (blue)**, your goal is to use the environment to your advantage. Wall-jump to gain height, use bounce pads to cross large gaps, and slide through narrow passages to create distance. Your Dash is your ultimate escape tool—save it for when the Tagger gets dangerously close.

As the **Tagger (red)**, your job is prediction and pressure. Don't just follow the runner's path; anticipate their moves and cut them off. Use your Dash to close gaps unexpectedly or to cross a section of the map faster than they expect. Cornering your opponent is more effective than chasing them in a straight line.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Learn the Maps:** Every map has unique routes and tricks. Spend time learning the fastest paths and safest spots.
2.  **Control Your Dash:** Your Dash has a cooldown, indicated by the circle around your character. A wasted dash can cost you the round, whether you're running or tagging.
3.  **Use Verticality:** Moving up and down is just as important as left and right. Use wall jumps to get above your opponent for a better view or a surprise attack.

## What Makes Tag 2 Special?

Tag 2 stands out by distilling the platformer genre down to its purest, most competitive form: the chase. There are no weapons or complex power-ups; victory is earned purely through movement skill and psychological strategy. Every round is a high-speed duel of wits. Will you juke left or right? Will you burn your dash now or save it? This focus on pure parkour mechanics creates an incredibly high skill ceiling that's immensely rewarding to climb.

Unlike longer-form games, Tag 2 is built for high-adrenaline, low-commitment sessions. The short, sub-minute rounds mean you're always in the action, creating a powerful "just one more game" loop. As a sequel, it offers a more polished and refined experience than its predecessor, with carefully tuned physics and more intricate map designs that challenge veterans while remaining accessible to newcomers. It’s the raw thrill of the chase, perfected.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does multiplayer work in Tag 2? Can I play with friends?

Tag 2 is a 1v1 online game that uses automatic matchmaking to pair you with a random opponent. Currently, most versions of the game do not feature private lobbies to directly invite and play with friends. The system is designed for quick, competitive matches against a variety of players to test your skills.

### What's the best way to use the Dash?

The Dash (Spacebar) is your most critical ability. As the Runner, save it for a last-second escape when the Tagger is about to make contact. As the Tagger, use it to surprise the Runner by dashing across a gap or cutting a corner they didn't expect. Using it wisely is often the difference between winning and losing.

### Is Tag 2 a difficult game?

Tag 2 is easy to learn but hard to master. The controls are simple, but winning consistently requires advanced movement like precise wall-jumping, strategic dashing, and deep knowledge of the map layouts. The fast pace is challenging, but each short round gives you an immediate opportunity to improve.

### Can I play Tag 2 on my phone or tablet?

Tag 2 is primarily designed as a browser game for PC using keyboard controls for precision. While some gaming websites might load on a mobile browser, the experience is not optimized and controlling your character without a physical keyboard is extremely difficult. For the best performance, a desktop or laptop computer is recommended.
