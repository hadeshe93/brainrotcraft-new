## How to Play Tunnel Ball?

Getting started in Tunnel Ball is simple, but mastery is a true challenge. Your ball hurtles forward automatically, so your only job is to steer it left and right to avoid a collision.

**Controls:**
*   Use the **A/D keys** or the **Left/Right Arrow keys** on your keyboard to navigate.
*   On mobile devices, simply tap the left or right side of your screen.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**
Your primary goal is to survive. The game begins at a manageable pace, but the ball's velocity steadily increases, demanding quicker reactions. The tunnel is filled with static and moving barriers in various patterns. Hitting any part of an obstacle will instantly shatter your ball and end your run. Your score is directly tied to the distance you travel, so every second you survive counts. As you play and achieve high scores, you may unlock new cosmetic skins for your ball, allowing you to customize your look as you chase new records.

**Tips for Beginners:**
*   **Look Ahead:** Don't focus on the ball itself. Keep your eyes fixed further down the tunnel to anticipate upcoming obstacles.
*   **Subtle Movements:** Avoid sharp, jerky turns. Small, controlled adjustments are more effective for navigating tight gaps.
*   **Stay Centered:** When possible, try to return to the center of the tunnel after dodging an obstacle. This gives you more room to react to the next one.
*   **Learn the Patterns:** While the tunnel is endless, certain obstacle combinations will reappear. Recognizing these patterns is key to survival at high speeds.

## What Makes Tunnel Ball Special?

While Tunnel Ball belongs to the popular endless runner genre, it stands out with its intense focus on pure, unadulterated speed and reaction. The game’s true magic lies in its hypnotic, ever-shifting visual design. The kaleidoscopic colors and warping patterns aren't just for show—they are an integral part of the challenge, testing your ability to focus amidst sensory overload.

Unlike similar games that might introduce complex power-ups or level-based progression, Tunnel Ball offers a distilled arcade experience. It's all about you, the tunnel, and the ever-increasing velocity. This simplicity creates an incredibly addictive "one more try" gameplay loop that players love. The difficulty curve is steep but fair, making every new high score feel like a monumental achievement. It’s the perfect game for those who appreciate a challenge that is easy to understand but incredibly difficult to master, rewarding pure skill above all else.
