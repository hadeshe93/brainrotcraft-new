## How to Play A Shedletsky POV?

Playing A Shedletsky POV is more like directing a short, animated comedy than playing a traditional game. Your role is to influence Shedletsky's reactions as the story unfolds automatically around you.

**Controls:**

- **Mouse:** Your only tool is your mouse. Simply point and click on the character Shedletsky.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

- The game consists of several short, automated scenes. In each scene, you'll see Shedletsky interacting with the environment or the mysterious entity, 1x1x1x1.
- By clicking repeatedly on Shedletsky, you cycle through a list of pre-written dialogue and reactions. You can make him act scared, confused, brave, or just plain silly.
- The story progresses on its own after a set amount of time in each scene, so your clicks don't advance the plot, but they do change the flavor and comedy of the moment.

**Beginner Tips:**

1.  **Click Everything:** In each new scene, click on Shedletsky multiple times to see all the different lines he can say. Many of the best jokes are hidden a few clicks in.
2.  **No Stress:** There are no puzzles, no combat, and no way to lose. You can't make a wrong choice, so just relax and have fun with the dialogue.
3.  **Replay for Gags:** The game is very short. Play through it a second time and try choosing different reactions to see how the tone of each scene changes. You'll likely catch jokes you missed the first time around.
