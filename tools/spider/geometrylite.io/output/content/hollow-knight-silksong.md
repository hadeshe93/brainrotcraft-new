## Hollow Knight: Silksong - A New Chapter in the Hollow Knight series

Hollow Knight: Silksong, the highly anticipated sequel to Team Cherry’s 2017 masterpiece, finally launched on September 4, 2025. Available across PC, consoles, and Nintendo’s Switch platforms, the game puts you in control of Hornet, the fierce and agile guardian of Hallownest. Unlike the Knight’s slower and more methodical approach, Hornet’s adventure emphasizes speed, grace, and precision as she battles her way through a kingdom steeped in danger and mystery.

## Fast, Fluid, and Fearless Gameplay

Silksong transforms the familiar Metroidvania framework into a faster, more dynamic experience. Hornet leaps higher, strikes faster, and wields a needle with deadly accuracy. Players can craft tools, accept quests from NPCs, and explore a sprawling world filled with traps, puzzles, and enemies that demand razor-sharp reflexes. Each encounter feels like a dance of [survival](https://geometrylite.io/tag/survival) where timing is everything.
