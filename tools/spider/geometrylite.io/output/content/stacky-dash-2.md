In **Stacky Dash 2**, your goal is to build bridges out of blocks by gathering and stacking them to get over different obstacles. Let's immerse ourselves in this second version's vivid and cheery graphics! 

## Introduce Stacky Dash 2

Welcome to Stacky Dash 2! This second version of [Stacky Dash](https://geometrylite.io/stacky-dash), a collection of brick-stack running arcade games with 3D cartoon stickman game art animations, is back. There are numerous intricate tracks in this revised edition. The protagonist must be controlled to slide to each track and gather the blocks there. 

## How to play

Like in the previous game, your goal is to run across a variety of terrain while gathering bricks. To build bridges, get past obstacles, and cross the finish line safely, you must use and handle these bricks carefully. The additional blocks will turn into diamond prizes when you finish.  

**Controls**

To move your character through the maze and gather every colored tile, use the arrow key.
