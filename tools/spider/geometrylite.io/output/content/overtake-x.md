## Overtake X: Speed, Style, and Split-Second Decisions!

Overtake X, a fast-paced driving game that combines classic endless runner principles with intense highway racing, has just been added to our [Racing Games](https://geometrylite.io/racing-driving.games) library. All you have to do in this game is weave through traffic, collect cash, and do dangerous overtakes to increase your score and unlock new cars. Successful overtakes will most likely give you points, fill up your boost meter, or help you progress through the task. Be advised that one error or delay could result in an accident, forcing you to start over!
