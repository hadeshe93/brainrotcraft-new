## Start a new journey in Geometry Dash Solar Circles

As the level's name implies, the primary focus of author D4rkGryf's design is sun energy. When you first launch the game, the details are decorated with sun-like and orange-colored decorations, which add a vivid impression. This is one of the D4rkGryf levels created in the classic design style. The player must overcome and complete the level to see the sun's dazzling rings.

### A level with a difficulty of 10 stars

There are 12,944 objects on this level that are 1 minute 5 seconds long. Even though this is simply an average length for a Medium Demon, defeating it will not be simple. The level is classed as challenging with ten stars; the first section is rather simple, but as soon as you enter the triple-speed Nine Circles wave segment, the pace will gradually change to the rhythm. Although there aren't many skills needed for this section, the player must pay close attention to movement accuracy.
