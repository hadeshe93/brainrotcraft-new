**Recoil** is a unique physics-based platformer in which you utilize the recoil of your pistol to drive yourself across stages and eliminate viruses. 

## Introduce the platform game Recoil

Recoil is Martin Magni's new platform game featuring entertaining and inventive gameplay. The player aims to control the little guy and utilize various [weapons](https://geometrylite.io/tag/weapons) to destroy the horrible pink viruses. The unique feature is that you cannot move and strike viruses directly. To accomplish this, you must use the recoil of a gun to propel your character around the screen and shoot at the viruses.

### Special tactics to defeat viruses

In this game, your goal is to defeat a horrible pink virus. Instead of attacking with standard weapons, you must control the main character's movement direction by using a gun's recoil. If you're trapped in a tight place or surrounded by viruses, utilize your weapon's recoil to propel yourself in a strategic direction. Remember that the recoil can also be used to avoid infections and getting struck.
