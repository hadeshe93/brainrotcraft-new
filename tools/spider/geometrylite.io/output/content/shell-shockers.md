In the well-known multiplayer first-person shooter game **Shell Shockers**, you take on the role of an armed egg and must shoot other players with your selected weapon to eliminate them.

## Gameplay of Shell Shockers

Shell Shockers was developed by Blue Wizard Digital and instantly became one of the hottest games in [.IO games](https://geometrylite.io/io.games) since its launch. Choose from a range of egg-based characters at the beginning of the game, each with a unique weapon loadout. To become the survivor, you must destroy other players with the weapons you have selected. Because the map is varied and full of surprises, you must have clever ideas for every terrain to succeed! Keep in mind that since this is a multiplayer game, your opponents are utterly arbitrary, unpredictable, and dangerous!
