**Geometry Stars** is a fast-paced arcade game inspired by Geometry Dash that requires you to cross several obstacle-filled stages. Are you ready to begin your journey to conquer rhythm and gain star points in Geometry Stars?

## Introduce Geometry Stars

Geometry Stars draws inspiration from rhythm-based platformers, therefore, the gameplay is very similar to Geometry Dash. This game transports you to a beautiful universe in which your avatar moves forward automatically. All you have to do is time your jumps and maneuvers to avoid obstacles like spikes, saws, and blockades. Each of the eight hard levels is meant to put your agility and precision to the test.

### Controls

Controls are simple: In jumping sequences, a simple tap or click moves your character over barriers. 

As you go, you will meet various dynamics, such as gravity reversals and flying sequences. Have fun!
