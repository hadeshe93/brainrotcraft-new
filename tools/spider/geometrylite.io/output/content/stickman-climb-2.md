In the physics-based game **Stickman Climb 2**, your character only has a pickaxe and has to avoid rocks and traps to get to the finish line safely. 

## **Introduce Stickman Climb 2**

In Stickman Climb 2, envision yourself as a cool stickman who adores climbing really high!  This is the sequel to [Stickman Climb](https://geometrylite.io/stickman-climb), a popular stickman climbing game known for its rage-inducing difficulty and oddly pleasurable controls.  You control a stickman with a single pickaxe. Your goal is to swing, dig, and climb your way through weird, obstacle-filled environments.  Remember that one inaccurate swing or mistimed jump can send you back to the start.

### **Features**

- One-pickaxe gameplay: minimal controls, maximum challenge.
- Realistic physics: Every movement is determined by gravity, swing angle, and momentum.
- Funny ragdoll animations: Half the fun and anguish comes from seeing your stickman flop.
