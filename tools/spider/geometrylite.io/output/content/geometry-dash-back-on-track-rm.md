**Geometry Dash Back on Track RM** reimagines one of Geometry Dash’s most iconic early levels. Created by [ZenthicAlpha](https://geometrylite.io/tag/zenthicalpha), this remix keeps the straightforward charm but raises the difficulty, making it both nostalgic and refreshing for players.

## **Introduction Geometry Dash Back on Track RM - A Remix of a Classic**

The original Back on Track was the second official level after [Stereo Madness](https://geometrylite.io/geometry-dash-stereo-madness), teaching beginners how to handle jump pads and trickier gaps. In contrast, Back on Track RM pushes these mechanics further with faster pacing, refined sync with music, and more precise jump placement, creating a remix that appeals to both veterans and newer fans alike.

### **Placement in the Sapphire Pack**

Back on Track RM holds the spot as the [Normal](https://geometrylite.io/tag/normal) - first level in the Sapphire Pack, giving players a welcoming but slightly more intense starting point. Its polished design and fitting soundtrack help set the tone for the rest of the pack, showcasing ZenthicAlpha’s signature remix style.
