**Geometry Dash Double Wave PRO** challenges you to control two waves at once through 22 tricky levels! Think you can handle double the chaos?

## **Introduce Geometry Dash Double Wave PRO**

Geometry Dash Double Wave PRO isn’t your ordinary wave challenge. Inspired by the original wave mode, this version doubles the madness by making you control two waves at the same time. With 22 levels to conquer — including a mysterious hidden fifteenth stage — it’s a test of [skill](https://geometrylite.io/tag/skill), timing, and patience that keeps players hooked.

### **How to play**

The controls are simple, but the execution is wild:

- Holding down the screen (or left mouse button) causes the waves to move apart in different directions.
- When you release the button, the waves will drift closer together before splitting again.

Your job is to guide both waves safely through spikes, tunnels, and obstacles at the same time. It feels easy at first, but once the levels [speed](https://geometrylite.io/tag/speed) up, things get chaotic fast.

### **Why Give It a Try?**

This game is perfect for fans who love Geometry Dash’s [wave](https://geometrylite.io/tag/wave) mode but want a brand-new challenge. The double-wave twist makes every move more intense, while the mystery level keeps you curious and motivated to push further. It’s frustrating, rewarding, and insanely addictive all at once.
