A Shedletsky POV retells [Roblox](https://geometrylite.io/tag/roblox)’s most enduring myth through Shedletsky’s perspective, blending playful humor with eerie legend. Dive into short, reactive scenes and uncover what 1x1x1x1 really means.

## **A Shedletsky POV: Myth, Humor, and Lore**

This interactive story lets you peek behind the curtain of Roblox mythology, focusing on the mysterious entity 1x1x1x1 and the “fourth dimension.” Instead of combat, you progress by choosing lines of dialogue, switching reactions, and watching quick, funny scenes play out. It’s a light narrative adventure that celebrates classic community lore.

### **Who Made It and Where It Runs**

The project comes from the Scratch community—credited to the creator DiaryOfACoolCat—so it runs smoothly in-browser and is easy for anyone to try. Its simple art and expressive faces keep the focus on the story beats and jokes rather than on complex mechanics.

### **How to Play**

Take a passive, director-style role: switch dialogues, trigger reactions, and nudge scenes forward to reveal new bits of lore. Your choices can lead to different responses and discoveries, rewarding replays if you want to catch every gag and hint.
