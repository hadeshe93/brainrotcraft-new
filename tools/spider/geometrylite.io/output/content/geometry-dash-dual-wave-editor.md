## **INTRODUCING GEOMETRY DASH: DUAL WAVE EDITOR**

**Geometry Dash: Dual Wave Editor**, developed by Kokim, is a fan-made spin-off of the [Geometry Dash series](https://geometrylite.io/geometry-games.games). It brings the Dual Wave mechanic into focus, letting players design levels where two waves must be controlled simultaneously. This takes the classic wave mode to a whole new level of challenge and creativity.

### **Build your dual wave challenge**

In this editor, you can place blocks, saws, and portals that directly affect how the dual wave moves. Special speed portals allow you to increase or decrease the pace of both waves, adding another layer of complexity. Once your level is ready, switch to play mode and try surviving the chaos you’ve built.

### **Controls**

- Hold the left mouse button/tap the screen – make the wave fly upward
- Release – let them fly downward
- Editor mode – drag and drop blocks, saws, or portals anywhere
