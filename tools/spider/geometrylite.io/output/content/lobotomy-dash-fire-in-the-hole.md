## **Introduce Lobotomy Dash: Fire in the Hole**

Unlike the sharp, geometric avatars you might be used to, Lobotomy Dash features distorted, meme-inspired characters drawn straight from the depths of internet humor. From chaotic doodles to unsettling creatures, the visuals are intentionally strange, making the game feel both hilarious and slightly unsettling. The soundtrack is another standout element. Instead of intense electronic beats or cinematic scores, you’re met with upbeat, cartoonish [music](https://geometrylite.io/tag/music) that contrasts wildly with the high-stakes gameplay.

### Features

- Explosive visual effects and erratic screen transitions that enhance the frenzy.
- Main characters from the Lobotomy universe lend a unique personality and style to the level.
- Cheerful and vibrant background music creates an odd juxtaposition with the intense gameplay.
