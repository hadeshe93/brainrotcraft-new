Geometry Dash Minecraft is a creative fan-made version built on Scratch, merging rhythm-based jumps with iconic Minecraft characters and worlds.

## **Geometry Dash Minecraft - A Creative Collision of Worlds**

Geometry Dash Minecraft is a fan-made project developed on Scratch, blending the rhythmic precision of Geometry Dash with the blocky charm of Minecraft. This imaginative crossover keeps the core mechanics of the original game intact — jump, fly, and dodge obstacles — but transforms everything into a vibrant [pixel](https://geometrylite.io/tag/pixel) universe filled with familiar Minecraft faces.

You’ll begin your adventure through three unique stages — Minecraft, Shedeh, and Pigstep — each offering a different palette, soundtrack, and [obstacle](https://geometrylite.io/tag/obstacle) design. The colors pulse to the beat, the terrain changes shape, and every move demands split-second timing. It’s a perfect mix of retro rhythm and sandbox creativity.

### **Jump to the Beat**

- Tap / Click / Spacebar / Up Key: Jump
- Hold: Keep jumping in rhythm
- Avoid: Spikes, moving blocks, and falling gaps
- Stay in sync: Every movement matches the beat of the background track

Geometry Dash: Minecraft stands out as one of the most creative fan-made remakes on Scratch. It brings together two legendary worlds — the precision of Geometry Dash and the sandbox wonder of Minecraft — creating a refreshing experience that feels both familiar and new.
