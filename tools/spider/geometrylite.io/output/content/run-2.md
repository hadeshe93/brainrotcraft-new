**Run 2** is the sequel to the popular Run series. This [endless runner](https://geometrylite.io/tag/endless-runner) game has the character auto-running forward while you navigate obstacles and reach as far as you can.

## **Run 2 - A New Chapter in the Run Universe**

Being the second installment, Run 2 keeps the endless runner spirit alive with improved visuals and new tracks. Unlike many runners, where you always move, here your character automatically runs forward, so your focus is solely on steering and [jumping](https://geometrylite.io/tag/jumping). Each run challenges your reaction time as you avoid gaps, spikes, and traps. The game is designed to gradually increase in difficulty to keep players engaged.

### **Controls & Gameplay Tips**

Gameplay is simple to grasp but hard to master. Since movement is automatic, mastering timing is key. Use short taps for small jumps and hold longer for bigger leaps. Try to memorize obstacle patterns on each level. If you often fail at a section, slow down your pace mentally and stay calm—practice will help you improve.

- Move left – Left Arrow
- Move right – Right Arrow
- Jump – Space Bar
