## **MineFun.io – Build, Parkour, Fight, and Survive in a Blocky World**

MineFun.io takes the charm of [Minecraft](https://geometrylite.io/tag/minecraft) and transforms it into an action-packed online experience. This block-based universe is more than just crafting—it’s about parkour challenges, epic battles, creative building, and [survival](https://geometrylite.io/tag/survival) showdowns. Whether you’re an architect at heart or a thrill-seeker chasing victory, MineFun.io has a mode for everyone.

### **Game Modes You Can Explore**

- Parkour Mode – Master the Jumps: Challenge yourself with tricky block courses that demand precision, timing, and balance. Every leap matters, and one mistimed jump could send you back to the start.
- Creative Mode – Build Without Limits: Tap into your imagination and design anything you want—houses, castles, or even an entire city. With unlimited resources, this mode removes the pressure of competition and focuses purely on creativity.
- Hide and Seek Mode – Outsmart Your Opponents: Disguise yourself as an object and hide, or play as the seeker and track others down. It’s a test of stealth vs. sharp eyes.
- War Mode – Battle for Survival: Arm yourself with weapons, collect coins, and fight against other players. Victory depends on both your aim and your movement strategy.
- Infection Mode – Survive the Outbreak: Run for your life as a survivor—or embrace the chaos as a zombie spreading the infection.
