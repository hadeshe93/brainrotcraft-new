**Wave Editor** is a fan-made Geometry Dash game where players design, test, and play wave-based levels with endless creativity. 

## **INTRODUCING WAVE EDITOR**

**Wave Editor**, created by Kokim, is a fan-made spin-off of the [Geometry Dash](https://geometrylite.io/geometry-games.games) universe. Instead of just playing levels, this version lets you design your own wave challenges with full control over obstacles, portals, and backgrounds. It’s both a creative sandbox and a rhythm-based challenge. 

### **Create your wave world**

Wave Editor focuses entirely on the wave mechanics from Geometry Dash. Players can place traps, portals, and decorations while customizing the level’s background and flow. Once your stage is built, switch to play mode and guide the wave through your custom-designed chaos. 

### **How to play**

When you start, you’ll see lots of buttons on the screen. Each has its own function, like the Play button to start your level.

- You control a diagonal wave that moves down by default. Hold down the left mouse button or tap the screen to make it fly upward; release to let it drop.
- Use this control to dodge obstacles and navigate your creation.
- Add obstacles and portals by selecting them, then dragging them anywhere on the screen with your mouse or finger.
- Move the screen around with the two-arrow button to build further.
- Change background color via the settings button.
- To delete objects, click the trash can button—anything you select while the button is red will be removed.
