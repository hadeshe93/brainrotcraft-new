## **Poligon Dash – Geometry Dash Reimagined in Vertical Style**

Poligon Dash, also known as [Geometry Vertical](https://geometrylite.io/geometry-vertical), is a thrilling twist on the popular Geometry Dash formula. Instead of side-scrolling gameplay, this fan-made version challenges you with a top-scrolling perspective, where you must guide your cube upward while avoiding a series of dangerous obstacles. The game combines speed, precision, and quick reflexes to deliver an addictive experience that feels both familiar and fresh.

### **Gameplay - Unique Style**

Unlike traditional Geometry Dash, Poligon Dash shifts the action to a vertical plane. Your cube constantly moves upward, and you must react quickly to dodge spikes, blocks, and other hazards in your way. This perspective creates a brand-new challenge for players, as the scrolling [speed](https://geometrylite.io/tag/speed) ramps up the intensity with each level.

**Controls:** Use the A and D keys for lateral movements.
