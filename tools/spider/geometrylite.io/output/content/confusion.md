## **Confusion – A Rhythm-Thriller User Level**

Confusion is a user-made level in Geometry Dash 2.1, crafted by level creator Schady. Rated as a 7-star [Harder](https://geometrylite.io/tag/harder), it mixes hectic movement, sharp timing, and intense transitions. The level stands out for its steel-blue and dark visual theme, constantly changing patterns, and a design that keeps your reflexes on edge. It blends numerous modes — cube, ship, ball, and UFO — into tight succession.

### **Navigate Chaos with Rhythm and Skill**

You guide your icon through rapid [obstacle](https://geometrylite.io/tag/obstacle) sequences where every beat counts. The level opens with cube jumps and narrow paths, quickly forcing you into waves of vehicle segments where precise control is critical. Gravity flips, tight corridors, and fast-moving platforms demand exact timing. If you’ve mastered normal Hard and Easy Demon levels and seek a compact yet demanding challenge, Confusion offers a perfect next step!

### **How to play**

- Jump / Tap: Up Arrow / W / Spacebar
- Use Practice Mode to place checkpoints and memorize tricky segments
