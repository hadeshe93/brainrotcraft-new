Geometry Dash Merge takes the addictive puzzle mechanics of [Suika](https://geometrylite.io/tag/suika) game and Tetris but swaps in the iconic Geometry Dash characters you know and love.

## **Geometry Dash Merge – Suika Meets Tetris with a Dash Twist**

Geometry Dash Merge - A lighthearted yet challenging game where precision and planning are just as important as speed. Your mission is to connect identical icons using your mouse or finger. Each successful merge creates a brand-new character, moving you closer to unlocking the full Geometry Dash roster. But beware—the game ends when your stack of icons crosses the top line.

### **How to Play**

- Click to drop: merge two identical characters.
- Plan your merges to create space for more icons.
- Don’t let the stack cross the top line—or it’s game over.
- Unlock all characters to complete your collection.
