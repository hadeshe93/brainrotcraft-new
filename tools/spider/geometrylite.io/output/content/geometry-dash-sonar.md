**Geometry Dash Sonar** is an Easy 2-star level that marks the very first challenge in the [Alpha Pack](https://geometrylite.io/tag/alpha-pack). With smooth gameplay and an upbeat soundtrack, it’s the perfect starting point for players looking to sharpen their timing and enjoy a lighter challenge.

## **Geometry Dash Sonar – A Rhythmic Entry in the Alpha Pack**

Developed by Minesap and JerkRat, Sonar quickly became one of the most downloaded [user levels](https://geometrylite.io/tag/user-levels) ever, racking up over 100 million plays. The level is powered by Stereo Madness 2 by ForeverBound, giving it an energetic rhythm that pairs perfectly with every jump, ship flight, and wave movement.

Sonar’s design is straightforward yet engaging—players navigate cube sections, a single ship sequence, and a short wave segment. While it’s considered an easy level, its clean sync with the music makes it a memorable experience.

### **Tips to collect all user coins**

- Coin 1 (31%): In the ship section, fly carefully between two small cubes at the top. Precision is key.
- Coin 2 (45%): During the cube section, skip [jumping](https://geometrylite.io/tag/jumping) onto the third pillar—drop down instead, grab the coin, then quickly jump back up.
- Coin 3 (67%): In the wave segment, dip down into the bottom opening of a large triangle obstacle, collect the coin, then steer up and out fast to avoid crashing.
