**Geometry Craft 3D** combines Geometry Dash with Minecraft, letting you dash through blocky worlds, dodge traps, and collect shiny gold bars.

## **GEOMETRY CRAFT 3D – DASH INTO THE BLOCKY WORLD**

Geometry Craft 3D is a fan-made mashup that mixes the [fast-paced](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fast-paced) rhythm of Geometry Dash with the blocky charm of [Minecraft](https://geometrylite.io/tag/minecraft). The cube dashes forward on its own, and your mission is to survive as long as possible while avoiding dangerous traps and tricky gaps. With every gold bar collected, the adventure becomes even more rewarding.

### **Speed, jumps, and blocky traps**

You’ll leap across platforms, dodge spikes, and make split-second decisions to avoid falling into the abyss. Each mistake sends you back to the start, but the thrill of improving with every run keeps the challenge alive. Collecting gold bars along the way adds extra excitement, giving you a reason to push further each time.
