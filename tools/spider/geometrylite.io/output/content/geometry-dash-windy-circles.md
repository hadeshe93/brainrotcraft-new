Welcome to Geometry Dash Windy Circles, another hard level in the [Nine Circles levels](https://geometrylite.io/tag/nine-circles) set. Prepare to ride the waves at an ever-changing tempo!

## Introduce Geometry Dash Windy Circles

Geometry Dash Windy Circles has a 10-star difficulty rating from keiAs. This is another user level that is highly complicated and best suited for advanced gamers. The non-wave areas alternate between colors and have a modest Nine Circles-style design. The concept is not overly sophisticated, but the challenge is focused on the wave parts, which rise in pace and need players to have extremely precise and rapid reactions to overcome. 

### Remember to Focus on Timing, Not Speed

Geometry Dash Windy Circles, like the previous user levels, is designed to synchronize with music. Your objective is to listen carefully to the beat and execute precise jumps and flights. You don't need to focus too much on the cube's speed; instead, find the best time to move to conquer the obstacles.
