**Experience triple interest in 3Dash! Challenge in three-dimensional maps, master multi-level challenges, and test your skills in this dynamic dash game.**

3Dash will triple the fun and challenge of space with extreme geometric maps. Players will step into a virtual world with beautiful 3D maps and unbelievable adventures. The difficulty of the game can be said to be overwhelming, with a fast pace that requires lightning reflexes. You will maneuver a character who can change form and state as he moves through different portals. Besides, rings and pads are also objects that make characters jump from the air (rings) or platforms (pads).

## **Understand the Detailed Gameplay**

Your goal in 3Dash is to control your character from the beginning to the end of the map. The immersive 3D platforming unlocks a whole new challenge and higher difficulty than the original game, [Geometry Dash](https://geometrylite.io/). Not only that, but your vision will also be troubled when the camera angle continuously rotates with each character's jump. Not only is it a skill factor, but observation is also extremely necessary for scenes that change perspective.

### **Control the Cube**

You can use the mouse keys, spacebar, or arrow keys to navigate your character. At the starting line, you need to press the key once for the character to start moving automatically. Each character shape will have a different way of moving. Note that the portals change shape to adjust the buttons properly.
