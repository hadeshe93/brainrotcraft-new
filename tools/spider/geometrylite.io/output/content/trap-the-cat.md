**Trap The Cat** is a remarkably simple yet extremely strategic puzzle game in which you must prevent a cunning cat from going out of a hexagonal grid.

## Introducing the Classic Puzzle Game: Trap The Cat!

Trap The Cat, an addicting and timeless brain teaser, will put your logic to the test as you block the cat's route one tile at a time. The gameplay revolves around a hexagonal grid, with a cat starting in the center. Your objective is to create obstacles by clicking on hexagonal tiles to keep cats out. You must strategically place tiles to surround the cat and keep it from reaching the edge.

### Tips and tricks

- Predict the direction: The cat normally travels towards the nearest edge. Attempt to forecast its route and block accordingly. 
- Consider many moves ahead: Don't respond to the cat's initial move; instead, plan for its next steps. 
- Create a solid barrier: Aim to form a continuous barrier around the cat; progressively closing in will help you trap it!
