## **GEOMETRY DASH: BLACK BALL – A DARK TWIST**

Geometry Dash: Black Ball takes the rhythm-platformer formula and flips it with a bold twist. Instead of the familiar cube, you now guide a jet-black ball blasting forward through sharp platforms and chaotic hazards. The dynamic backgrounds shift colors constantly, adding even more intensity to every jump.

### **Features that raise the challenge**

- A new jet-black ball character instead of the classic cube.
- Dynamic color-shifting backgrounds for a fresh visual experience.
- Tight, reflex-based gameplay with one-click control.
- A mix of spikes, saws, and minimal safe platforms for maximum challenge.

### **One click, endless pressure**

The rules are simple, but the execution is ruthless. With a single click, you’ll control the [ball](https://geometrylite.io/tag/ball)’s movement as it hurtles past spikes, saws, and impossible-looking gaps. Every moment feels like a split-second decision, and the sharper visuals push you to stay focused.
