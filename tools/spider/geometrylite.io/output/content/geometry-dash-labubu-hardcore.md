**Geometry Dash: Labubu Hardcore** brings ultra-challenging [wave](https://geometrylite.io/tag/wave) mode action with tight controls, deadly traps, and a fierce test of your reflexes.

## **Survive the Madness in Geometry Dash: Labubu Hardcore**

If you're craving an intense challenge, Geometry Dash: Labubu Hardcore delivers it in full force. In this fan-made wave mode edition, you control Labubu—a fluffy yet fearless character—navigating through brutally difficult levels packed with spikes, moving platforms, and relentless traps. It’s fast, unforgiving, and utterly addictive.

### **How to Play**

Your goal is to reach the end of each wave-based level without crashing. The character auto-moves, and your job is to guide Labubu up or down by holding or releasing your input—just like traditional wave gameplay.

**Controls:**

- Tap or hold the left mouse button
- Press and hold the Spacebar or Up arrow key
