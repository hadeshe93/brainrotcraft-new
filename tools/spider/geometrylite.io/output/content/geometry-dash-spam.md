**Geometry Dash Spam** tests your tapping speed and rhythm to the limit with Geometry Dash's Wave mode. Are you ready to push your reflexes to the limit?

## What Is Geometry Dash Spam?

Geometry Dash Spam is a fan-made challenge based on the [Wave](https://geometrylite.io/tag/wave) mode of Geometry Dash. Unlike typical levels, Spam challenges rely solely on [high-speed](https://geometrylite.io/tag/high-speed) tapping in straight fly parts that require lightning-fast reflexes to create waves while traveling. The main premise is straightforward: tap faster than you ever thought possible — and don't let go; quick taps are the only way to survive! There is no complicated level navigation - just a pure test of speed, rhythm, and finger strength.

### Survival Tips

- Pure Tap Challenge: There are no distractions—only you and your clicks.
- Practice: Improve your straight fly control and click consistency.
- Remember, focus on rhythm rather than speed: Controlled spam outperforms frantic tapping.
