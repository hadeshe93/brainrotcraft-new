**Atari Breakout**, the legendary arcade game, has been popular for many years due to its timeless, immensely engaging gameplay.

## Introduce the Classic Gameplay of Atari Breakout 

Atari Breakout is a classic arcade-style game that remains popular among players of all ages. Your main objective is to destroy all of the bricks on the screen by bouncing a ball off a paddle at the bottom. You will use this paddle to control the direction of the ball. When the ball strikes a brick, it disappears and the player scores points. The game becomes more challenging as the ball speeds up, and you must have lightning-fast reactions to toss it in the right spot. 

### Controls

- Move the mouse cursor to move paddles left and right.
- To move the paddle, use the A/Left and D/Right arrows respectively. 
- To spawn a ball, use the right spacebar.
