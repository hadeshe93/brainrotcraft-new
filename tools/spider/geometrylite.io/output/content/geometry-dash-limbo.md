## **Geometry Dash LIMBO – The Demon Megacollab That Shook the Community**

In the world of Geometry Dash, few levels are as iconic—or as brutally difficult—as Geometry Dash LIMBO. Created through a massive megacollab and released in late 2022, this [Extreme Demon](https://geometrylite.io/tag/extreme-demon) pushes players to their absolute limits. With a 10-star rating and a runtime of 3 minutes and 27 seconds, LIMBO is more than just a level—it’s a masterclass in high-level gameplay, rhythmic precision, and visual storytelling.

It was rightfully awarded Best Demon Megacollab in the Geometry Dash 2022 Awards, and it secured the #2 spot in GDToday’s 100 Greatest Levels of All Time, only trailing the historic level Slaughterhouse.

### **Highlights**

- Visual Theme: LIMBO’s glitchy, fragmented world is unlike anything else—dark, surreal, and emotionally charged.
- Music Sync: Every portal, spike, and shift pulses perfectly with the music.
- Gameplay Variety: Dual segments, size changes, mirror portals, and split-second reactions are everywhere.
