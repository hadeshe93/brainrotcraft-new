In the arcade game **Only Up Balls**, you control balls that are moving and have to get past different obstacles to reach higher levels. Of course, you want to get as high as you can!

## The gameplay of Only Up Balls

In Only Up Balls, the main objective is to control bouncing balls and guide them to achieve new heights by avoiding obstacles. Only Up! and other well-known parkour games play a lot like this. Selecting the Single Player or [2 Player](https://geometrylite.io/tag/2-player) game mode is the first step. Keep in mind that each level gets harder with time, so you have to finish them all to move on to the next.

### Controls

- Player 2: To move, press the arrow keys; to jump, press K; to respawn, press L.
