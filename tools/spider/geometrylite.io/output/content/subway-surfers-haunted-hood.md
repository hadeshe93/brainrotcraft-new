## Introduce Subway Surfers Haunted Hood

Subway Surfers Haunted Hood is a new version based on the iconic arcade game Subway Surfers. Prepare to begin a journey by running forward along the railroad tracks, earning gold coins as you go. The environment in Subway Surfers: Haunted Hood is unique; instead of the usual train tracks from the original version, the race will take place in a frightening abandoned village. Many eerie components have been added to the theme, offering gamers a disturbing but incredibly interesting experience. 

### How to play

Accompany the main characters as they navigate obstacles such as barriers, trains, and traffic lights. Get on your fantastic hoverboard before the evil security guard and his dark companions capture you. On your trip, try to acquire as many coins as possible; these will allow you to access new, unique personalities.
