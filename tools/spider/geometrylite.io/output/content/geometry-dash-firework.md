**Geometry Dash Firework** is an [Extreme Demon](https://geometrylite.io/tag/extreme-demon) developed by Vernam, Trick that features unique gameplay. This is one of the shortest levels, but it is popular for its stunning design and loud soundtrack.

## Special design in Geometry Dash Firework 

The background of Geometry Dash Firework is primarily gray and white, with a hint of red in certain places to provide a slight contrast to the monochromatic design. Though they are careful in every way, the colors are not overly complex. One of the most striking features of this level is how the grayscale and falling particles create an atmosphere that is a little frightening. It seems like ash falling from the sky.
