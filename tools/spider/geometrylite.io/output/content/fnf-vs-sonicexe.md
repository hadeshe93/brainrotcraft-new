A new FNF game mod, **FNF vs Sonic.EXE**, has been added to our collection. It's time to defeat your rival once more to win the affection of your girlfriend and her father.

## Introduce FNF vs Sonic.EXE 

FNF vs Sonic.EXE is regarded as one of the greatest Friday Night Funkin' mods available and was inspired by the creepypasta of Sonic.exe. This game is a must-have if you enjoy the [FNF](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fnf) series music game! Let's venture into the world of pure terror and get ready to battle the creepypasta Sonic. Maintain your speed and focus despite the odd things that may happen, even if you find yourself in an unfamiliar and depressing environment! 

## How to Play 

You can play this game with WASD or Arrow Keys, just like in previous FNF variants. The goal is to push the keys as soon as the notes reach the judgment line on the screen.
