**Geometry Dash v1.5** is a fan-made version created in Scratch that remakes three original Geometry Dash levels. The controls and gameplay mirror the original, but you can play it freely online on Scratch.

## **Geometry Dash v1.5 - A Fresh Take on Classic Levels**

This fanmade v1.5 version faithfully recreates three official Geometry Dash levels (Stereo Madness, Back on Track, Polargeist) within Scratch. Its goal is to give players access to core Geometry Dash fun—for free—with slightly tweaked physics and visual effects. It draws from the original but adds its own charm. It’s popular among the Scratch community with remixes and versions built by users.

### **Controls, Mechanics & Gameplay Tips**

Gameplay is simple yet challenging: time your jumps carefully to dodge spikes and obstacles. If visual effects cause slowdowns, press L to make the game smoother. Memorizing patterns and repeating tricky parts will help you beat each recreated level.

- JUMP – \[Space\], \[W\], \[Up\], \[Ctrl\], or mouse click
- PAUSE – \[P\]
- LAG (effects toggle) – \[L\]
- Restart – \[Green Flag\]
