## What is Tag 2?

Tag 2 is a chaotic [multiplayer](https://geometrylite.io/tag/multiplayer) action platformer where the classic playground tag game turns into an intense digital chase. With fast movement, unpredictable obstacles, and tricky jumps, you’ll need sharp reflexes and smart movement to stay untagged. Whether you’re chasing or running, every round is short, sweaty, and full of clutch moments.

This sequel ramps things up with new maps, smoother movement, and tighter chase mechanics—perfect for fans of quick competitive fun.

## How to Play

Movement is key. Learn to jump between platforms, slide into tight corners, and cut sharp turns to throw off your opponent. If you're the runner, use high ground and bounces to keep distance. If you're the tagger, predict routes and corner your target fast—hesitation loses games.

### Controls

- W / Arrow Up – Jump
- A / D / Arrow Left / Right – Move
- Spacebar – Dash / Burst movement (when available)
