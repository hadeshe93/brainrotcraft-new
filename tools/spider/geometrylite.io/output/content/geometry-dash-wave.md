### Gameplay Overview

Unlike the standard square, which jumps and falls, the Wave can move up and down by holding and releasing the screen (or the spacebar, depending on your platform), adding another level of intricacy to the already difficult stages. This innovative mechanic necessitates precision as you negotiate small corridors, dodge spikes, and respond quickly to stay alive.
