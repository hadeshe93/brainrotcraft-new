Welcome to **Geometry Dash Maze Maps V2**! Explore new rhythm-based mazes and more difficult obstacles in this brilliant [fan-made](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fan-made) sequel by atupdev.

## **Geometry Dash Maze Maps V2 – The Maze Just Got Trickier**

Geometry Dash Maze Maps V2 is the second chapter of the Geometry Dash Maze Maps fanmade series, created by community member atupdev. Unlike the normal linear levels seen in the original Geometry Dash games, this sequel reverses the formula—players must navigate complicated maze-like patterns while keeping up with [fast-paced](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fast-paced) electronic music. It's more than just [jumping](https://geometrylite.io/tag/jumping) to survive; you'll need to choose your course and solve rhythmic puzzles on the fly.

### **What’s New in Version 2?**

- Nonlinear Maze Design - You don't merely move forward. You will have to navigate twisted tunnels, looping paths, and branching decisions.
- More Complex Obstacles - New traps, decoys, and distractions surface regularly, challenging both time and memory.
