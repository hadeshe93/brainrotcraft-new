The gameplay of **World's Hardest Game** is as difficult as its name implies! This game needs you to strategize to complete each level's task.

## World's Hardest Game Rules

The game's principle is straightforward. When you first start the game, you will see yourself as the red square at the beginning place. The goal is to get to the finish line (marked in green) while avoiding blue circles and collecting yellow circles. It should be noted that while the rules are basic, they are difficult for players to master, especially at later levels. The red square will encounter a succession of increasingly difficult levels riddled with obstacles, shifting hazards, and tricky timed problems. The blue circles will rapidly multiply, forming a complex maze that will be difficult to navigate!

### Tips to play this game

Do not haste to move after entering a level. Take your time observing the layout, opponent movements, and potential safe areas. Plan your movements wisely so that you can get to the safe zone quickly and avoid getting recognized by the blue circle. Be especially cautious on fast-moving blue circle levels, which might put you in peril in a split second. 

### Controls

Use arrow keys to move the red square.
