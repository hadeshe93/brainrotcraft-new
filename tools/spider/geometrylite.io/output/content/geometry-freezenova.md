**Chill out or put your skills to the test with Geometry FreezeNova! Can you overcome icy obstacles and slide to the finish line in this frosty platformer?**

## **Introduce Geometry FreezeNova**

Geometry FreezeNova opens up a beautiful geometric world with shimmering neon lights every step of the way. Start a tough journey with a small cube and conquer difficult challenges. You will encounter countless barriers, complex terrain, and dangerous traps. Skillfully maneuver your character to avoid all those threats and reach the destination. Uncontrollable speed movements can make you dizzy. But you can play multiple times until you win, do not be discouraged. Until you master every level, don't give up.

[Geometry FreezeNova](https://geometrylite.io/geometry-freezenova) has nine awkward levels with increasing difficulty arranged in the menu. You can choose any round to participate in without having to play in order. In addition, players can also collect coins scattered around the map to unlock new characters.

## **How to Play**

The difference between this game and Geometry Dash is that the character does not have many transformation shapes. Therefore, players can quite easily get used to the movement characteristics of the cube to perform precise jumps.

You can use one of the following three keys to control your character: the spacebar, the left-click, or the up arrow. To have consecutive and evenly spaced jumps, you just need to hold down the command key.
