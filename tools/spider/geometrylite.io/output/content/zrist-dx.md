**Experience the intensity of Zrist DX! Join in futuristic levels to dodge high-tech obstacles and unleash your skills in this adrenaline-pumping adventure.**

Zrist DX welcomes you to the speed race with more thrilling experiences. You will join the journey with a cube that can jump up or slide down. The barriers that constantly appear are the challenges you need to avoid. Each different segment has new changes in map design. This endless adventure will last hundreds of levels until an unfortunate collision occurs. Except for the red boxes, all other terrain is safe for the cube to move through. However, you will not be able to manage the character's speed, so don't be negligent at any time to conquer impressive scores.
