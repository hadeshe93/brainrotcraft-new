Welcome to Dune! This is a rhythm-based physics platformer in which you control a rolling [ball](https://geometrylite.io/tag/ball) and use gravity to glide, dive, and dodge through difficult environments.

## **Dune – Glide, Bounce, and Control Gravity Like a Pro**

Dune is not your typical platformer; it's a slick, physics-based puzzle in which precise movement and exact timing are essential. The game puts you in charge of a rolling ball, navigating it through flowing hills, sudden drops, and uneven slopes. Your job? Adjust your pace, control gravity, and [avoid](https://geometrylite.io/tag/avoid) falling into the dangerous edges that can finish your run in a moment.

### **How to Play – One Touch, Infinite Possibilities**

- To dive faster, hold down your mouse or tap.
- Release to launch into the air.
- Time your dives to glide gracefully across dunes, land neatly, and gain speed.
