## **Geometry Dash Lite Scratch – A Creative Fan Remake**

Geometry Dash Lite Scratch is a fan-made recreation of the beloved [Geometry Dash Lite](https://geometrylite.io/), developed entirely on the Scratch platform by passionate creators. This version keeps the heart-pounding rhythm gameplay intact while introducing fresh twists in visual effects, transitions, and player movement. Players will instantly recognize familiar levels, but each one carries a new layer of creativity and experimentation, showing just how flexible and imaginative the Scratch community can be.

### **Gameplay Overview**

Jump, fly, and flip through obstacle-packed levels synced to dynamic electronic beats. Every tap must be perfectly timed, as a single mistake sends you back to the start. The Scratch version features slightly rebalanced mechanics, making jumps and gravity shifts feel distinct while still staying true to the original.

**Controls:** Press space/forward arrow/ or mouse pointer to jump.
