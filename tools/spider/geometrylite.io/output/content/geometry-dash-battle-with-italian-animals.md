## **Introduce Geometry Dash: Battle with Italian Animals**

Geometry Dash: Battle with Italian Animals is a fan-made twist that throws absurd humor into the familiar Geometry Dash formula. Instead of just navigating spikes and platforms, you’re now dodging and outsmarting hilariously named Italian animal characters—each adding their own quirky flair to the chaos.

### **Absurd Enemies, Intense Action**

From the fierce Bombordiro Crocodile to the unpredictable Glorbo Frutodrilo, every foe you meet is a strange yet oddly charming [obstacle](https://geometrylite.io/tag/obstacle) in your rhythmic journey. The game keeps you in Wave mode, demanding precision taps to rise and fall while avoiding hazards these “brainrot” animals bring to the stage.

### **How to Play**

- Tap or click to control the [wave](https://geometrylite.io/tag/wave)’s height.
- Release to descend and press again to ascend.
- Time your movements to dodge obstacles and animals.
- Complete the level without crashing to claim victory.
