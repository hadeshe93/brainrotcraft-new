## **99 Nights in the Forest – Survive the Haunted Wilderness**

99 Nights in the Forest is a [survival](https://geometrylite.io/tag/survival) horror game that pushes you to endure 99 terrifying nights in a cursed forest. By day, you search for clues to find missing children. By night, you fight to stay alive against the forest’s horrors — bandits, strange creatures, and the fearsome Cannibal Deer that hunts under the moonlight. This isn’t just a test of endurance — it’s a story of survival and courage.

### **Explore, Build, and Survive**

Your journey begins with nothing but determination. Collect wood, food, and materials to build a safe shelter before darkness falls. Each night brings tougher challenges — new enemies, scarce resources, and the constant terror of being hunted. Explore the forest for lost children and hidden dungeons. Every discovery brings you closer to the truth but also deeper into danger. Only the most resourceful players can survive all 99 nights.

**Controls:**

- Use WASD to move.
- Use LMB to choose your weapons/drag an item.
