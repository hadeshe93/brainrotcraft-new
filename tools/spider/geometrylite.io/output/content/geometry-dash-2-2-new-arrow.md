## **Geometry Dash 2.2: New Arrow – Monochrome Speed and Precision**

Geometry Dash 2.2: New Arrow, created by faraonovvit, reimagines the classic [Wave](https://geometrylite.io/tag/wave) mode experience with a minimalist twist. Featuring only black-and-white visuals reminiscent of Geometry Arrow, this fan-made project strips away distractions and focuses purely on your skill. But don’t let the name fool you—the arrow is just the beginning.

### **More Than Just an Arrow**

While the Wave mode remains the heart of gameplay, you’ll also take control of a [ball](https://geometrylite.io/tag/ball), ship, and other forms, each with unique movement styles. Switching between these forms mid-level keeps the action fresh and demands razor-sharp reactions.
