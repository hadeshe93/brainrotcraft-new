**Race against time in Among Dash, dash through asteroids, and suppress cosmic challenges in a thrilling dash game inspired by outer space adventures!**

Among Dash's awkward space exploration is ready to take down the best of adventurers. You will transform into a small character in the Among Us universe. The dangers you must avoid are voltage capacitors, radioactive grass, and dangerous electrical currents. This never-ending journey will be the ultimate challenge for all types of players. Whether you are a professional or a beginner, you can try your hand at it to see how good a player you are. The ability to improvise quickly and choose the correct key press time will be the most important factors.

### **Maneuver Your Character in Among Dash**

Your character will move automatically. That means you won't be able to customize the pace of the round. At the same time, each turn will be a map with a completely different structure. Therefore, be highly focused and promptly improvise in every situation. Use the mouse button as a supreme assistant to control your character's divine jumps. It all depends on your timing skills!
