## **About Slope Rider – Winter Runner in Neon 3D**

In Slope Rider, you speed downhill through a thrilling neon-winter world filled with traps, tunnels, and icy hazards. This fan-melting version brings a fresh twist to the classic “[Slope](https://geometrylite.io/slope)” genre, placing you on a sleek ball or sled, racing against the slope and your reflexes. The visuals pop with vibrant neon colors, and the terrain constantly shifts — new segments, surprise turns, falling obstacles — making every run different.

### **Gameplay**

- The game is endless: the track keeps going until you crash.
- You roll or sled downhill in a 3D environment, weaving through steep descents, twisting paths, and flashing hazards.
- Snow boulders, falling trees, ice bridges, and sudden chasms add variety and tension.
- Unlockable sleds or balls can be collected (in some versions) by surviving longer or gathering items.
- Each restart brings a new map layout and visual theme, boosting replay value.

### **Controls**

You steer your ball or sled with simple left-and-right controls while it hurtles down the slope at high speed.
