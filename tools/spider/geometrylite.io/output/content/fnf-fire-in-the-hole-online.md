Welcome to **FNF Fire in the Hole Online**! An iconic Geometry Dash meme served as the impetus for this mod's creation. With Boyfriend, let's start five musical battles from the Lobotomy universe against nimble balls!

## New version of FNF: FNF Fire in the Hole Online

With FNF Fire in the Hole Online, [FNF](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fnf) is back and better than ever. The well-liked Lobotomy levels from Geometry Dash—which are famous for the meme "Fire in the Hole"—were the inspiration for this hack. Boyfriend and Pico are competing fiercely for the time ball of the lovely girl, with Normal, a green ball, as the loser. Players can begin playing the lively melody-filled matches right now. This level's playlist of songs consists of:

- Lobotomy
- Logodomy
- Moist Hills
- Rocky Grounds
- Lobotomy Dash Funkin’

Take in the lively music and demonstrate that you can feel every note right now!

## How to play

As soon as the notes cross the judgment line, you must push the keys. The music will pick in speed as the game gets harder. To master the complete song selection, put your all into your concentration and develop your hand skills.

### Controls
