This sequel puts your timing and reflexes to the test with new levels, intense obstacles, and faster-paced platforming. Each jump matters, every coin counts, and one mistake could cost you the entire run.

### **Classic Controls, Sharper Threats**

This second installment keeps the simple yet addictive one-touch control system. Just tap or press the spacebar to make your [cube](https://geometrylite.io/tag/cube) leap through danger.
