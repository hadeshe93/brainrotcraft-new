## **Geometry Platformer - A Neon-Packed Adventure**

Geometry Platformer delivers basic platforming action and amps it up with a bright, [fast-paced](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fast-paced) aesthetic. You control a cube that twists and rushes past geometric traps, testing your timing and attentiveness. The basic yet colorful [neon](https://geometrylite.io/tag/neon) visuals make every move stand out as you sprint to the end.

### **How to Play**

Controlling your cube is simple, but surviving is tough:

- WASD keys → Move your cube in all directions.
- Collect blue geometry shapes to boost your score.
- Avoid spikes and obstacles — one wrong move ends your run.

### **Tips to Master the Game**

- Stay centered on the platform to keep options open.
- Collect blue shapes whenever safe — but survival comes first.
- Don’t rush — sometimes slowing down helps you last longer.
