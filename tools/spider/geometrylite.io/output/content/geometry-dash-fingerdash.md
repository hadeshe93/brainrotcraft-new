Geometry Dash Fingerdash, the twenty-first main level, takes everything you’ve learned and pushes your skills to the limit. From tricky portals to intense transitions, this Insane-rated level is a fast, fiery finish to the core series.

## **Overview of Geometry Dash Fingerdash**

Fingerdash is the final official level in the base Geometry Dash game and one of the most dynamic. With a 12-star [Insane](https://geometrylite.io/tag/insane) difficulty, it introduces a stunning lava theme, glowing red-and-black effects, and some of the most advanced mechanics seen in the series. This level is a visual treat too, with fiery animations, chain-swinging backgrounds, and pulsing obstacles that match the beat of the music. 

### **How to Get All 3 Secret Coins** 

- First Coin (42%) – Collected during the spider section. Tap at the right moment to teleport through a small opening instead of continuing the normal route.
- Second Coin (55%) – Found in the ship section. Stay low and fly precisely through a tight corridor to reach it.
- Third Coin (79%) – Another spider-mode coin. Just like the first, you’ll need to teleport through a secret route to grab it.
