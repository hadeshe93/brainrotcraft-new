**Rhythm Ball 3D** is an enjoyable music game in which you guide a ball through a perilous tunnel.

## Introduce Rhythm Ball 3D 

In Rhythm Ball 3D, you guide a colour-changing ball through a tunnel lined with blocks of various colours. Start the game by selecting your favourite song. Your ball smashes are always travelling downhill through colourful circles. However, it can only proceed through circles of the same colour; if it touches a different colour block, it breaks apart and you must restart.

## How to play

- Smash the same colour block.
- Hold and drag your mouse to make the ball move as you want.

At the end of the voyage, aim to collect as many coins as possible. You can use it to unlock additional fantastic songs with increasing difficulty in the collection.
