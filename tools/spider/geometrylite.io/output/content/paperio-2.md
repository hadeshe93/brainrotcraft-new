In the multiplayer game **Paper.io 2**, you compete against other players from all around the world to fill as much of the arena as you can. Make a name for yourself on the leaderboard and begin your expansion trip!

## Your task in Paper.io 2

In **Paper.io 2**, you have to create a line that denotes your territory to navigate a rectangle character and capture as much ground as you can. When extending your territory, you must proceed with extreme caution, as you will lose the game if another player breaks your line before you can connect it to your area. It's a multiplayer game with top players from all over the world, so it's not just going to be a straightforward tactical expansion of territory!

### Tips and tricks

Quickly enlarging your area puts you at risk of being attacked by other players. To lessen the chance of being cut off, it is therefore safer to carefully extend your area, remain near it, and frequently duck in and out of it.
