**Powerline.io** is a wonderful arcade game that was recently added to our [.IO games](https://geometrylite.io/io.games) library. Enter the multiplayer arena and engage in fierce competition!

## Introduce gameplay of Powerline.io 

You must begin chasing and competing with numerous other luminous lines in Powerline.io to become the strongest line in the region. Move cautiously around the arena to begin gathering energy crystals; avoid running into other lines as you risk losing right away. You must plan cunning maneuvers to enclose or trap opposing lines so they are forced to collide with you to destroy them. After that, gather their remaining energy to expand and raise your score.

### Controls
