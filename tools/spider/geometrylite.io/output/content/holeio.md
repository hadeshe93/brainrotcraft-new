**Hole.io** is a brand new .IO game that puts you in the role of a growing black hole that is attempting to absorb everything in sight. You are challenged to compete against other players and against the passage of time.

## Gameplay of Hole.io

All you have to do in Hole.io is move your void around a bustling cityscape, consuming buildings and vehicles. You may even make your opponents become the biggest! Move your hole around the map with easy controls and watch as it eagerly swallows up smaller objects. The more you eat, the greater your hole becomes, allowing you to devour increasingly larger stuff!

### Highlight Features of Hole.io

- Satisfyingly destructive gameplay: It's a rare sensation to witness a complete cityscape fade into your emptiness.
- Competitive [Multiplayer](https://geometrylite.io/tag/multiplayer): Real-time clashes with other players provide an exciting element of rivalry.
- The variety of maps and skins: This keeps the visual experience fresh and allows for some player customisation.
