## **Welcome to the Christmas-themed game: Xmas Dash!**

Xmas Dash is a Christmas-themed game inspired by the classic gameplay of the famous game, Geometry Dash. Transforming into Santa Claus in cube form, you will go on your adventure on a complex map. Tricky obstacles like razor-sharp spikes, saw blades, and a variety of terrains disrupt the serene scene on Christmas Eve. You will face extreme challenges with the most flexible and precise movements. The spaces also pose a danger from tall pillars coming from both sides of the terrain.

### Introduce Gameplay of Xmas Dash

Your character in Xmas Dash can transform into the ship form to fit certain segments with specific terrain. Besides, players can change the look of the cube by watching a short ad to unlock it. The character's ability to slide or fly straight down can make your jumps more thrilling than ever. Furthermore, pay attention to jumping orbs and cushions to take advantage of for efficient movements. Also, don't forget to collect Christmas gifts, candy canes, and delicious cookies to make your achievements even more impressive.

### **How to start your adventure?**

To start the round, first choose a character skin that you like the most. A satisfactory companion will help gamers have more motivation for the arduous journey. If you are a new player, you should try the practice mode first (click on the candy cane icon). The checkpoint feature in this mode will help players not need to start from the beginning when a collision occurs.

If you are confident in your abilities, start the main game right away and remember to press the left-click or the spacebar key most accurately to complete the map.
