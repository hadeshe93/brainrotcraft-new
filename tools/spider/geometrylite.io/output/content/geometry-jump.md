**Dash through geometric landscapes of Geometry Jump and avoid all tricky obstacles. Test your reflexes or explore something more interesting!**

Geometry Jump is an appealing platform game with the magical jumps of a lonely cube. Upon entering the harsh geometric map of the virtual world, you will experience the most heart-stopping feelings. Your mission is to maneuver the cube to dash across spikeless platforms, avoid all obstacles, and successfully reach the finish line. However, completing this mission will not be simple because the character can transform into different shapes. In each of these shapes, the main entity has unique movement characteristics that create diversity in gameplay. Precise controls are the key to victory.

In particular, Geometry Jump introduces a completely new feature: speed adjustment. Players can customize their character's movement speed. No more breakneck pace and awkward roads. Now, you can practice right in the main rounds at a pace to which you can adjust yourself. Besides, you can also direct the character to collect coins on the map.

### **How to Play**

First, you need to choose one of the levels with different difficulties to participate in. It doesn't have to be done in order; you can choose any round you like. During the main game round, you use the mouse button or spacebar to control the character. To adjust the speed, click on the pause icon in the right corner of the screen to display the tool panel.
