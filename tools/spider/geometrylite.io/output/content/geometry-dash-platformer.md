**Geometry Dash Platformer** is a fan-made game that reimagines Geometry Dash with unique levels and fresh challenges. Players will enjoy platforming action similar to the original, but with new twists and tougher obstacles.

## **Geometry Dash Platformer’s Level Journey: From Easy to Extreme**

This fan-made version features 13 distinct levels, ranging from Easy to Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. As you progress, the difficulty ramps up and tests your reflexes. The hardest levels contain invisible platforms, meaning you never quite know where to step next—making each jump a surprise. Each level is custom-made (so you won’t see the same layouts in the official Geometry Dash).

### **Gameplay Mechanics & Tips**

The gameplay mimics classic Geometry Dash’s platformer mode: move left and right, jump over hazards, avoid spikes, and reach the end. Unlike auto-scroll levels, you control your movement freely. Invisible platforms demand memorization and sharp reaction. Tips: play slower first to learn platform positions, use practice mode to explore invisible parts, and stay calm—mistakes are expected!
