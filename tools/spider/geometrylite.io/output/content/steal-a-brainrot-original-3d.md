## **INTRODUCING STEAL A BRAINROT ORIGINAL 3D**

Steal a Brainrot Original 3D is a unique fan-made game created by Nagami Games, inspired by the popular [Roblox](https://geometrylite.io/tag/roblox) title Steal a Brainrot by BRAZILIAN SPYDER and Sammy.

Best of all, it’s completely free to play.

Every stolen Brainrot boosts your wealth and brings you closer to becoming the ultimate collector.
