**Geometry Dash 3D: Build a Level**, created by Quix, is a unique fan-made spin-off of the Geometry Dash series. Instead of only running through levels, this version gives players the tools to design their own challenges in a vibrant 3D space. It’s a chance to be both a creator and a player at the same time.

## **Introduce Geometry Dash 3D: Build a Level - Gameplay**

The core of this fan game lies in its simple yet flexible level editor. You can place platforms, spikes, and traps across different perspectives, bringing a new twist to the classic Geometry Dash mechanics. After [building](https://geometrylite.io/tag/building), jump right in to test your design or explore levels created by others. The 3D visuals add depth and difficulty, making each run feel more dynamic.

### **How to play**

- Play Mode: Tap, click, or press spacebar to jump and [avoid](https://geometrylite.io/tag/avoid) obstacles.
- Build Mode: Drag and drop blocks, traps, and platforms to craft your custom stage.
- Test your creation instantly, then refine it to make it more fun—or more brutal.
- Share your level with friends and challenge them to beat your design.
