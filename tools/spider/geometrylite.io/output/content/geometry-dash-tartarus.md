**Geometry Dash Tartarus** is a legendary Extreme Demon mega-collab with 10 stars, renowned for its extreme difficulty and legacy among top players.

## **Conquer the Legendary Challenge of Geometry Dash Tartarus**

Geometry Dash Tartarus is not for the faint at heart. This [Extreme Demon](https://geometrylite.io/tag/extreme-demon) level has ten stars and is regarded one of the most difficult tasks in the Geometry Dash world. Tartarus, originally hosted by [Riot](https://geometrylite.io/tag/riot), is a mega-collaboration between some of the game's most talented creators, mixing fierce gameplay with beautiful design.

### **Why Tartarus Stands Out**

- Extreme difficulty: Precision timing, [fast-paced](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fast-paced) portions, and unrelenting wave sections make this level one of the most difficult ever constructed.
- Megacollab power: Tartarus, created by a team of top-tier creators under Riot's guidance, boasts a varied range of gameplay and visual effects.
- Soundtrack: The soundtrack for the level is "Clubstep" by DJ-Nate, a nostalgic and dramatic track that perfectly complements the high-stakes experience.

What truly elevates Tartarus is its legacy. Ranked #66 in GD. It is widely regarded as one of the 100 Greatest Levels of All Time, stretching the boundaries of player skill and innovative design.
