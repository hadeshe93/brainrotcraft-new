**Geometry Dash: Black Spider** is a rhythm-based platform game featuring a Black Spider that takes you on a more complex trip than traditional jump-based gameplay.

## About Geometry Dash: Black Spider

Geometry Dash: Black Spider, with its dark and eerie backdrop, promises to take players on a hard trip to overcome rhythm challenges. The game preserves the gameplay of leaping to the rhythm and overcoming obstacles to reach the finish line, like in the original game. However, the main character, Black Spider, will make the gameplay more difficult and sophisticated than traditional jump-based games.

### Special Features of Geometry Dash: Black Spider

One of the most notable distinctions between Geometry Dash: Black Spider and Geometry Dash is that the character is a Black Spider rather than a standard cube. This changes the gameplay; instead of hopping over barriers as usual, the player must control the Black Spider to shift the direction of gravity and climb to walls, navigating narrow passages and continually changing the positions of obstacles.

### How to play

Choose from a variety of difficulty levels, including easy, regular, hard, harder, and insane, to match your skills and tastes. Begin your obstacle course today by listening to the music and clicking the screen to change direction!
