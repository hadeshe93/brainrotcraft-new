Test your reflexes in Geometry Wave Challenge, a fan-made game inspired by [wave](https://geometrylite.io/tag/wave) mode, featuring 5 increasingly tough levels in a black-and-white design.

## **Introduce Geometry Wave Challenge**

Geometry Wave Challenge is a fan-made spin on the iconic Geometry Dash experience, focusing entirely on the thrilling wave mode. With five progressively harder levels, this game strips away distractions and delivers pure skill-based gameplay that rewards sharp reflexes and steady focus.

### **Gameplay**

The controls are simple yet demanding:

- Hold your mouse to make the wave fly upward.
- Release to make it dive downward.

Timing is everything, as even the smallest mistake can send you crashing into obstacles. The challenge ramps up with each new stage, ensuring that both beginners and advanced players stay on edge.

### **Design & Atmosphere**

Unlike many colorful Geometry Dash spin-offs, Geometry Wave Challenge embraces a minimalistic black-and-white theme. This clean design highlights the intensity of wave mechanics, letting players focus entirely on precision and rhythm. Every near miss feels sharper, and every success feels more rewarding.
