Welcome to **Geometry Dash: 3D Wave**! This is a [fan-made](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fan-made) level in Geometry Dash, a popular rhythm-based platformer, featuring distinctive "[Wave](https://geometrylite.io/tag/wave)" theme gameplay.

## About Geometry Dash: 3D Wave

Geometry Dash: 3D Wave has the same rhythm-based gameplay as the original Geometry Dash, plus a few tweaks and enhancements. Geometry Dash: 3D Wave is known for its beautiful 3D effects, which provide gamers with an enjoyable experience. Instead of manipulating a standard cube, the player directs a "Wave" form that moves up and down until it safely reaches the finish line (indicated by a green platform).

### How to play

Click and hold the mouse to control the Wave up; release and the Wave will automatically descend. If you strike the tunnel's upper or lower lines, you will lose and have to start over. Geometry Dash: 3D Wave is precisely timed with the beat of the music, so pay attention to the rhythm to move appropriately!
