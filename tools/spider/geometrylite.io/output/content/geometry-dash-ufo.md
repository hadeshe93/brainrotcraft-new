In Geometry Dash UFO, you don’t just play—you create your UFO-style levels. Using a built-in level editor, you can place blocks, saws, portals, and speed zones that influence the UFO's bouncing movement.

## **Design and Fly Your Challenges**

- Full Editor Tools: Tap buttons to select items—blocks, saws, [gravity](https://geometrylite.io/tag/gravity) portals, and speed modifiers. Drag them into place, pan the screen, adjust background color, or delete with the trash icon.
- Dynamic UFO Mechanics: Your UFO will bounce on tap (mouse click or screen). The portals and obstacles you place determine trajectory and speed.
- Endless Creativity: The sandbox-style editor offers limitless combinations. Experiment with timing, bounce patterns, and portal sequences to craft unique challenges.

### **How to play**

- Create: Click on tool icons to choose [obstacle](https://geometrylite.io/tag/obstacle) or portal type—then drag it onto your level layout. Use pan arrow tool to expand your design area.
- Test: Press Play to try your level as a bouncing UFO. Bounce by clicking or tapping to ascend, then crash or complete the level depending on your design
