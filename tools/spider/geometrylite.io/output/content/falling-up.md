## **Introduce Falling Up – A Legendary Challenge from KrmaL**

Falling Up is an Extreme Demon (10 stars) level created, verified, and published by the veteran Geometry Dash creator KrmaL. It stands as one of his most recognizable projects, praised for its blend of creativity, atmosphere, and tight gameplay. The level’s design transitions through multiple vivid environments — from glowing city skylines to stormy skies and finally, a radiant heaven-like finale filled with rainbows.

### **Gameplay**

Players are thrown into five straight-flying segments that demand near-perfect control, along with [gravity](https://geometrylite.io/tag/gravity) shifts and dual sequences that require flawless synchronization.

- The first [cube](https://geometrylite.io/tag/cube) section immerses you in a glowing cityscape, challenging you to maneuver through timed jumps and tight gaps.
- As the music intensifies, the second drop introduces a rainy, storm-lit setting filled with [fast-paced](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fast-paced) transitions.
- The final dual part brings you to a bright, heaven-like environment where your coordination skills are tested one last time before the climactic finish.

### **Why You Should Play Falling Up**

Falling Up is more than a test of skill — it’s a showcase of visual storytelling and rhythmic mastery. Its combination of aesthetic design, emotional music, and unrelenting challenge has made it one of the most respected player-created Extreme Demons in Geometry Dash history
