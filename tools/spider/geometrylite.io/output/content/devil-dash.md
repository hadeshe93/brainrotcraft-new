### Introduce Gameplay

Devil Dash has a total of 16 gates, with a final station called Monster Gate. Players need to complete the levels one after another to unlock rounds and gates in order. Each gate will be a specific type of obstacle. You can discover this uniqueness when participating in the first level of each gate. The rules of the game are not complicated at all: navigate the cube to the exit to escape. But getting to the destination will require many rounds of effort.

### **Dash with Your Cube**

Players use the arrow keys to navigate the small cube. However, sometimes these command keys will be used to maneuver a number of other objects. If it's revealed, what's better! Experience it for yourself and reveal all the unbelievably appealing and addictive features of this game!
