**Brainrot Animals Geometry Dash** is a wild, meme-fueled reimagining of classic Geometry Dash gameplay, complete with crazy [animal](https://geometrylite.io/tag/animal) characters plucked straight from Gen Z meme culture.

## **Introduce Brainrot Animals Geometry Dash**

**Brainrot Animals Geometry Dash**, inspired by the viral brainrot fad and featuring demented animals such as funny cats, weird capybaras, and feral frogs, takes a wild approach to the classic dash formula. Instead of navigating an iconic cube through a level filled with spikes and saws, imagine controlling an arrow and overcoming obstacles that are twisted creatures plucked directly from the deepest reaches of the internet's "brainrot" culture.

### **Why Play Brainrot Animals Geometry Dash?**

If you're weary of polished, serious games and want something fun, flawed, and memorable, this is it. Every level is an adrenaline rush because of the combination of good gameplay and complete ridiculousness. It's part platformer, part meme, and all brainrot.
