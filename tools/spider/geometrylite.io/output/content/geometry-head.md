**Geometry Head** takes the essence of Geometry Dash and reimagines it in a simpler yet equally addictive format. This fan-made spin-off replaces the platform levels with a continuous survival challenge where your cube must avoid an endless stream of geometric hazards.

## **Geometry Head – Cube Reflex Challenge for Hardcore Players**

Your main objective is to tap to move the cube up or down while navigating a corridor of randomly generated shapes. Each [obstacle](https://geometrylite.io/tag/obstacle) is placed to catch you off guard, testing both reaction speed and focus. The farther you go, the faster the game becomes—turning a simple tap into a real test of skill.

### **Chase the Ultimate Distance Record**

Every second you survive adds to your distance score. Aim to break your personal record, earn badges, and prove you can keep your [cube](https://geometrylite.io/tag/cube) alive longer than anyone else. With quick restarts and unpredictable obstacle patterns, one more try is never enough.
