**Orbit Dash** is a space-themed arcade game that pushes your reflexes with fast-paced action and an outstanding rope-swing element. Swing, launch, and speed across an infinite universe of orbits!

## **Your Goal is Orbit Dash**

In Orbit Dash, you must [avoid](https://geometrylite.io/tag/avoid) crashing as you jump between spinning orbits. Your character, a sleek cosmic sphere, glides automatically through a scrolling space scene. The game will start off simple, but it will quickly become more difficult as the pace, timing, and patterns become more intricate. The playground is limitless, with obstacles and momentum puzzles becoming more difficult the further you travel, so keep attentive!

### **How to play**

- When you're near a hook or anchor, press and hold to grab the rope and rotate it in a circle. 
- Release at the optimal moment to take advantage of inertia and soar toward the next anchor—or risk flying into the emptiness.
