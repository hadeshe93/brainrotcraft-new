## **Obby With Friends: Draw and Jump - A Creative Spin on the Classic Obby Adventure**

Obby With Friends: Draw and Jump is a multiplayer casual parkour game inspired by the beloved Roblox “Obby” genre. This unique twist lets players draw their own platforms to cross gaps, climb walls, and survive tricky challenges. Instead of just jumping from block to block, your pencil becomes your greatest tool — and sometimes, your downfall!

### **How to Play – Draw Your Path to Victory**

You’ll control Obby, a determined artist armed with a pencil and eraser, navigating through levels filled with gaps, spikes, and moving traps.

- Draw platforms beneath your feet to cross empty spaces.
- Erase mistakes or redraw quickly to adjust your path.
- Jump, climb, and balance to avoid falling — one slip means restarting!
- Cooperate with friends to complete levels faster, combining drawings for creative solutions.

### **Controls**

- WASD / Arrow Keys: Move
- Space: Jump
- Left-Click: Interact with buttons

Whether playing solo or teaming up with friends, creativity and timing are key. Each stage requires quick thinking, clever drawing, and solid platforming skills to survive.
