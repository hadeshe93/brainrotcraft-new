## Introduce Spooky Dash 

Spooky Dash is inspired by the famous [Geometry Dash series](https://geometrylite.io/all-games), with similar map design and character movements. If you are a fan of this genre, you should definitely miss this fascinating game with a unique theme. Jump on high poles, slide across platforms, ride on a broom, and fly up and down in space. Any way that can help you reach the finish line can be tried. You won't know how to overcome difficult obstacles if you don't try. Also, don't forget to unlock other skins for your pumpkin. Furthermore, participating in practice mode will also help you experience a satisfying map with unique images during the mysterious masquerade night.

### Maneuver your pumpkin

Controlling a cube to move continuously is not simple. However, with just a left-click or the spacebar, you can completely master your professional navigation. Your job is to accurately align the most reasonable movements of the character. For the rest, let the small cube help you take care of jumping and overcoming tricky barriers to reach the finish line.
