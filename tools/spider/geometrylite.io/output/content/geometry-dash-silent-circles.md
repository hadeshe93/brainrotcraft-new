An extremely difficult challenge, even for experienced players, is Geometry Dash Silent Circles, one of the most played impossible levels. One of Silent Circles' most challenging elements is the wave stage. The fact that this wave has two players in addition to being little. Because of the way the level is designed, the player must manage both waves simultaneously, and the pathway is filled with blue orbs that further confuse the player.
