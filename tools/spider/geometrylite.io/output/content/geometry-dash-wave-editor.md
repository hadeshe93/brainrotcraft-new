## Introduce the Gameplay of Geometry Dash: Wave Editor

In Geometry Dash: Wave Editor, the waves once again serve as the final challenge. At this user level, the player must face one of the most exciting and difficult challenges: Wave. This game allows users to control a little wave that is constantly moving up and down. To navigate through tight places and obstacles, you'll need precise control and timing. 

### Introducing common obstacles

To complete Geometry Dash: Wave Editor, players must be familiar with and know how to overcome some of the obstacles that appear frequently throughout the levels listed below.

- Spikes: This is one of the most prevalent obstacles you'll face in any place, and it often takes precise movement to avoid.
- Gravity Fields: When the player encounters this barrier, the direction of gravity is shifted, causing the wave to move from up to down or vice versa. To beat this obstacle, you must have quick reflexes and stay calm.
- Moving Platforms: As the level progresses, the player will encounter more moving obstacles that must be jumped over with precision.
