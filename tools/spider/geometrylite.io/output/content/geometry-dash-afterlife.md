## **Welcome to Geometry Dash Afterlife — Where Light Meets Shadow**

Geometry Dash Afterlife is a [Normal](https://geometrylite.io/tag/normal) level (10-star) created by Nasgubb, featuring 3 collectible coins and serving as the first level in the Discord Gauntlet. Originally made for the Discord Gauntlet Contest, this masterpiece earned second place for its mesmerizing art direction and polished structure. What makes Afterlife stand out is its symbolic transition from bright, warm tones to dark, somber shades — a visual metaphor for crossing between life and the afterlife.

## **Gameplay Overview**

Afterlife follows the traditional Geometry Dash rhythm-based format but adds a strong artistic twist. Players move through two distinct paths, each offering a unique tone: the first shines with vibrant, lively energy, while the second shifts to a darker, melancholic world. Jump, fly, and dodge as the tempo intensifies — timing and rhythm are key.

### **Coin Locations**

- Main Path: At 56%, fly into the tree trunk — the coin will be collected automatically.
- Alternate Route: Near the end of the level, the coin floats above a column — free to grab before finishing your run.

These coins encourage exploration, giving you reasons to replay both routes for 100% completion.
