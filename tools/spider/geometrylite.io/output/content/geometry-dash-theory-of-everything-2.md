**Geometry Dash Theory of Everything 2** is a [Hard Demon](https://geometrylite.io/tag/hard-demon) level by Neptune that recreates one of the most difficult official levels, Theory of Everything.  

## Introduce Geometry Dash Theory of Everything 2

Geometry Dash Theory of Everything 2 - This version of Neptune introduces new difficulties with a stunning design and a high level of perfection that you must not miss! Prepare to start on a new voyage lasting 1 minute and 29 seconds, with 14,667 things. This well-known level has multiple fakes, hard areas, and the notoriously bugged gravity gates in the wave section. To pass, players must make numerous efforts to learn the patterns, particularly during the changing and hard wave levels. 

### Explore Features of Music Synchronization

Like prior versions, Theory of Everything 2 has all of its obstacles timed to the beat of the music. A rhythm-based challenge is produced when the timing of leaps, sprints, or evasions aligns with musical aspects. Therefore, the secret to success is to make the right decisions and lose yourself in the rhythm and feel.
