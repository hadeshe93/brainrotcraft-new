Welcome to **TapTap Shots**! This is the most recently updated title in our [Basketball Games](https://geometrylite.io/tag/basketball) collection. Tap Tap Shots requires you to continuously tap to make a basketball bounce into the basket.

## Introduce TapTap Shots

In Tap Tap Shots, each tap drives the ball higher, necessitating exact timing and control to score. The goal is to score as many consecutive baskets as possible before the timer runs out. This game becomes more fascinating as each successful shot resets the timer and moves the hoop to a new location, increasing the difficulty.

### How to play

Simply click to juggle the ball and get it into the basket as much as possible.
