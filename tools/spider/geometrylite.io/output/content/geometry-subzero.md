**Enjoy impressive rhythm and awkward barriers in the obstacle course game, Geometry Subzero. Get ready to clear hard tracks and win glorious victories!**

## **Introduce Geometry Subzero**

Geometry Subzero is a rhythm-based obstacle course game. This is a game version of the famous original series, [Geometry Dash Lite](https://geometrylite.io/). Gravitations designed with incredible difficulty are also the core element that creates the appeal of this game. Gamers will win when they control the character and overcome all barriers to successfully reach the finish line.

Similar to other versions in the series, Geometry Subzero has some common terrain, such as top triangles, stairs, jumping balls, narrow tunnels, and walls protruding from both sides of the screen. Each gravity portal will transform the main entity into a different shape, such as balls, airships, and robots. The game ends when players navigate the object, avoiding boss attacks, and leap to the finish line.

## **How to play**

The main object in Geometry Subzero will automatically move straight. You need to maneuver the entity to jump, fly, and run away from obstacles. You can choose one of the following command buttons:

- Click on the screen
- Press spacebar

Do you have a lightning reflex skill and want to find a suitable game to challenge it? This is definitely the game for you! Not only that, gamers also need to be able to navigate accurately down to each pixel. The slightest collision can cause your round to end regretfully. Don't be discouraged; practice many times to conquer complex maps.
