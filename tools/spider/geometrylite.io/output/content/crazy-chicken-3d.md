Welcome to **Crazy Chicken 3D**! This is a chaotic, physics-based battle royale game in which you control a feisty chicken, attempting to outmanoeuvre and outlast your opponents in bright 3D environments.

## **Introduce Crazy Chicken 3D**

Inspired by the fan-favorite [Crazy Cattle 3D](https://geometrylite.io/crazy-cattle-3d), Crazy Chicken 3D swaps sheep for chickens, delivering slapstick collisions and unpredictable gameplay that will keep you laughing and engaged. You play the role of a battle-hardened chicken, flapping and bashing your way through numerous farm-inspired arenas. The goal is straightforward: be the last chicken standing. With no weapons or upgrades, winning is purely dependent on your strategic manoeuvres, timing, and understanding of the game's physics-based mechanics.

### **Controls Guide**

Use the WASD keys to navigate and the spacebar to jump.
