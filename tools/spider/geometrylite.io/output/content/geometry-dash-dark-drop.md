## Tips to collect all user coins

- The first coin: To grab the first coin, you have to jump from the block and click on the invisible jump orb at 4%.
- The second coin: The second coin is that you have to jump right after exiting the cube portal at 61% in the cube segment.
- The last coins: In the wave section, the final coins are at 77% because the wave is precisely above the usual path and moves across the narrow area to gather the remaining coins.
