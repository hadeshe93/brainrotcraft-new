## About Geometry Dash The Yandere

Even for advanced players, Geometry Dash The Yandere is considered a difficult level to achieve 100% due to the relatively unusual gameplay. Many obstacles occur at a rapid pace during the 60%-85% stage, which is one of the most difficult stages of Geometry Dash The Yandere. Stay focused from the start, listen to the rhythm, and become acquainted with the level design to conquer all traps and perils. 

## How to play

With background music, navigate a little icon—a cube, spacecraft, ball, or UFO—through a succession of obstacles. You have to steer clear of gaps, spikes, and other dangers with a single button control.
