## About EvoWorld.io

As the name suggests, EvoWorld.io transports you to a planet where you must live by flying, devouring other prey, and becoming larger. If you are not careful, you may be eaten by larger opponents, and the game will end. A fair strategy is to avoid your natural adversaries, particularly if you are a little creature. Move to choose your food, then grow and evolve into the next species. Have fun!
