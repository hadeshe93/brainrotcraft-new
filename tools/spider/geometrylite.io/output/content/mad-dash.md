## **Mad Dash: Minotaur’s Maze of Mayhem**

Mad Dash, by Liminal Creations Pvt. Ltd, is a [fast-paced](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fast-paced) 2D [pixel](https://geometrylite.io/tag/pixel)‑art platformer released in April 2025. You're cast as a tenacious minotaur stranded in one of the galaxy's remaining mazes. To conquer each level, you must jump over traps, dash across chasms, and race toward glowing portals—all as hazards intensify with every step.

### **What Makes the Game Addictive?**

- Maze-style Levels: Each level features platforms, spikes, pits, switches, and tight corridors—progressively more complex.
- Mad Dash Mechanic: Jumping first, then double-tap to dash mid-air—cover extra distance, [avoid](https://geometrylite.io/tag/avoid) spikes, or reach platforms beyond reach.
- Skill-Packed Challenges: Colors shift; pace increases; new traps and layout twists keep the difficulty climbing.

### **Controls**

- Move Left/Right: A/D or ←/→
- Jump / Dash: Press Up Arrow, W, or Space (double-tap in mid-air for dash)
