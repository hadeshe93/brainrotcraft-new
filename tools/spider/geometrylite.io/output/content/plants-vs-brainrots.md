## **Plants Vs Brainrots - Where Plants Defend Against Meme Madness**

Plants Vs Brainrots is a Roblox hybrid of tower defense and tycoon simulation. Play to build a garden, plant defenses, and protect your base from Brainrot enemies — meme-inspired creatures that march in waves. This game merges the playful charm of [Grow a Garden](https://geometrylite.io/grow-a-garden) with strategic tower defense mechanics, wrapped in a meme-filled universe.

### **Strategy, Collection, and Survival**

- You start with a small amount of money to buy seeds and plant them in your garden. These plants automatically attack incoming Brainrots moving along a conveyor belt or catwalk.
- Defeated Brainrots are then added to your base and generate income over time. Use the currency earned to unlock stronger plants, gear, and expand your garden.
- Rare Brainrots yield higher earnings, and mutated versions offer even greater rewards. Multiplayer mode allows you to play with others in a shared [defense](https://geometrylite.io/tag/defense) space.
