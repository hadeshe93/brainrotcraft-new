Geometry Dash Blast Processing delivers a glowing 3D challenge with gravity shifts, dual-mode action, and three hidden coins to test your reflexes.

## **Geometry Dash Blast Processing: A Neon-Powered Rush**

Geometry Dash Blast Processing, the seventeenth level in both Geometry Dash and [Geometry Dash Lite](https://geometrylite.io/), introduces players to breathtaking visuals and slightly more challenging mechanics. This level, with a [Harder](https://geometrylite.io/tag/harder) difficulty rating, bridges the gap between basic and advanced gameplay by combining [fast-paced](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fast-paced) action with bright 3D visuals.

_Pro Tip:_ Blast Processing is a great level to practice before tackling harder dual and gravity-heavy challenges like Theory of Everything 2 or [Deadlocked](https://geometrylite.io/geometry-dash-deadlocked).

### **Portal Mechanics**

Blast Processing stands out with its 7 manipulation portals:

- 5 gravity portals that flip your cube’s orientation
- 2 dual portals that split your character into two, requiring sharp coordination

These mechanics are introduced gradually throughout the level, allowing you to grasp without feeling overwhelmed.
