## **What Is Edge of Destiny?** 

Edge of Destiny is one of the most iconic Extreme Demon levels in Geometry Dash 2.1. Created by CDMusic and verified by Polterghast, it’s a full remake of the classic [Blade of Justice](https://geometrylite.io/geometry-dash-blade-of-justice). The level spans 2 minutes and 6 seconds, built from over 192,000 objects, and stands as a true endurance test for skilled players. Every second in this level demands precision — from lightning-fast wave transitions to complex dual sections. 

It’s no surprise that Edge of Destiny won the Best Extreme Demon Award (2023), solidifying its place among the most celebrated creations in Geometry Dash history. 

### **How to play**

To conquer Edge of Destiny, players must develop rhythm, muscle memory, and absolute control. Focus on the music cues, since each beat often signals a shift in gravity or gameplay pace. Precision is crucial during the wave and ship sequences, where a single mistimed tap can send you crashing. 

**Controls:**

Up / W / Spacebar – Jump or fly upward
