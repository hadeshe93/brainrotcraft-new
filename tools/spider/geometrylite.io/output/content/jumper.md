## **JUMPER – Leap, Dodge, and Conquer the Sky!**

JUMPER is a fast-paced vertical platformer created by Playgama, inspired by the legendary [Doodle Jump](https://geometrylite.io/doodle-jump). This exciting arcade-style game challenges you to leap endlessly upward while avoiding tricky traps, collecting power-ups, and testing your reflexes as you chase your highest score. With its vibrant visuals, smooth controls, and cute unlockable skins, Jumper keeps every run fresh and fun.

### **Gameplay**

In JUMPER, the rules are simple — go up, never stop, and don’t fall! The platforms shift, vanish, and trap you when you least expect it, turning every climb into a battle of reflexes. Collect glowing stars and quirky power-ups to boost your jump or gain temporary shields. The higher you go, the wilder the action gets — and the sweeter your rewards become. Dodge spikes, bounce off boosters, and watch out for disappearing tiles. Your timing is everything.
