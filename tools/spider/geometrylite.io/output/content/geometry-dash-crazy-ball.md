## Geometry Dash Crazy Ball: A Hard level from izhar

Geometry Dash Crazy Ball is a new Geometry Games release that will put your abilities, timing, and reflexes to the test in a unique and thrilling way! Izhar designed this level, and it rapidly became one of his most popular. Despite being classed as a Hard level, many players consider Crazy Ball to be manageable, with only 5 stars. However, if you want to put your rhythm-conquering skills to the test, this is a hard level to try.
