Welcome to **Geometry Dash Level Editor – 2.0.4**! This is a fan-made Scratch game by CaptainFlufBall where you can edit Geometry Dash level online.

## **Geometry Dash Level Editor – 2.0.4**

Geometry Dash Level Editor – 2.0.4 is a [fan-made](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fan-made) version of Geometry Dash, created by CaptainFlufBall on [Scratch](https://geometrylite.io/tag/scratch). This version brings the joy of designing custom rhythm-based platformer levels, offering creative tools for players to craft and test their own obstacle courses. With a familiar Geometry Dash interface and smooth building features, it's perfect for fans who want to create rather than just play.

### **Controls**

- Right Arrow or Spacebar – Advance to the next slide or step
- Left Arrow – Go back to the previous slide

While this Scratch version is a fun fan project, we’re excited to share that you can now create your own Geometry Dash levels directly at geometrylite.io — a new platform built for fans, by fans.
