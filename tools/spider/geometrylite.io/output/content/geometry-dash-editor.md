**Geometry Dash Editor** for PC lets you unleash your creativity! Create your own levels, add obstacles, establish checkpoints, and challenge your friends. Create infinite enjoyment!

## **Design Your Own Dash! Welcome to Geometry Dash Editor!**

Have you ever zoomed through a Geometry Dash level and thought, "Hey, I could make something even cooler!"? So now you can! Prepare to unleash your inner game designer with the Geometry Dash Editor! This special edition allows you to be the creator, designing incredible new levels for yourself and other players to jump, fly, and dash over. Make your craziest Geometry Dash dreams come true!

### **Instructions to create your level**

- **Start Your Design:** When you open the Editor, a red circle will appear on the screen. This is the "Start Pos," where your character will begin the level. You can change this starting point by pressing the Left Mouse Button (LMB) on the button in the bottom left corner of the screen, then clicking on any unoccupied space in your level.
- **Adding objects:** Want to include spikes, bricks, or portals? You make other items in the same manner! Simply take them from your toolbox and arrange them anywhere you like.
- **Checkpoints for Fun!** To help players practice tricky parts, you can add a green diamond or crystal. This is a checkpoint! If a character enters it and then falls or crashes, they will magically appear back at that checkpoint, ready to try again!
