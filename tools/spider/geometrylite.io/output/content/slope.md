**Slide down the rooftops in Slope! Rolling through twisting tracks, avoiding obstacles, and testing your reflexes in this fast-paced, downhill adventure.**

Slope is not only an endless running game but also a test of the highest skills. Prepare to hit the track with just you and an endlessly rolling ball! Your task is not difficult: control the ball through obstacles. It sounds simple, but it's actually a spectacular, unpredictable danger. The tricky obstructive shapes and sudden changes of rooftops will overwhelm you.

The beautiful neon city opens with countless complex obstacles. Slope that constantly change state, single red blocks that warn of danger, and objects that can move to crash into your ball. Because there is no destination, the suspense increases even more. Your score will depend on your performance with the ball throughout the journey. Slope promises to offer more heart-stopping experiences. But, you can still feel the entertainment factor in this appealing [arcade](https://geometrylite.io/arcade.games) game!

### **Roll the Ball**

At the beginning of the turn, the ball will immediately roll without stopping. The impacts that can make the ball roll faster are the short ramps at the end of each platform. You use the left and right arrow keys to navigate the main entity. The round will end when a collision occurs or the ball falls to the roadway below.
