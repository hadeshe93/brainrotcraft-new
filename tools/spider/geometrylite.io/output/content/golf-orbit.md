## Golf Orbit: Launch your golf ball as far as possible!

Golf Orbit is a 2D sports game in which you play as a golfer and hit the [ball](https://geometrylite.io/tag/ball) as hard as you can, even from other planets! The force of each shot is determined by where it falls; the ball will go far and then stop a few moments later. To send the ball as far as possible, you must alter the power with which you strike it on specific terrain. You can use the coins and jewels you earn to increase the appearance and power of your golfer, as well as the behavior of the ball.

### Controls

- Click the Left Mouse Button to stop the power meter at the desired strength and angle. 
- When putting, hold down the Left Mouse Button and drag the mouse to change the directory, then release to put.
