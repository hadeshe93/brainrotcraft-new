## **Overview of Papa’s Freezeria**

Papa’s Freezeria was developed by Flipline Studios and originally released in 2011 as a browser game. The game is part of the wider Papa Louie franchise and is popular for its peaceful yet interesting gameplay loop and colorful characters. In this game, you play as a worker left in charge of an ice cream shop on Calypso Island. Your duty is to accept orders, mix and blend the ideal frozen desserts, add the correct toppings, and keep customers satisfied.

### **How to play**

You must take their orders and then prepare the sundaes based on their instructions across many stations:

- Order Station: Here, you greet customers and collect their orders, noting the cup size, ice cream flavors, mix-ins, syrups, and toppings they want.
- Build Station: At this station, you choose the appropriate cup size and pour the desired ice cream flavor. For each taste, make sure to fill the cup to the appropriate line.
- Mix Station: If the customer requests mix-ins, you will place them here and then blend the sundae for the set amount of time (chunky, regular, or smooth).
- Top Station: You can add your desired toppings, such as whipped cream, cherries, sauces, sprinkles, cookies, and more. Accuracy in placement is often critical.
