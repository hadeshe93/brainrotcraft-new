## **Undead Corridor – Endless 2D Zombie Survival Firefight**

Undead Corridor throws you straight into nonstop zombie chaos. You enter a narrow battleground swarming with undead coming from every angle, and there’s only one goal: survive. Each wave gets tougher, forcing you to aim carefully, reload at the right time, and manage your ammo while zombies close in. With simple controls and escalating intensity, the game rewards sharp reflexes and smart resource use.

### **Gameplay**

Zombies rush toward you in waves, starting slow but quickly turning into overwhelming swarms. You shoot, reload, kick enemies off when they get too close, and switch weapons strategically to avoid running dry during critical moments. The more zombies you eliminate, the more upgrades and weapons you unlock, allowing you to push deeper into the chaos.
