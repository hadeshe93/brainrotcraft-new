**Geometry Worlds** is a [fan-made](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fan-made) Geometry Dash game with 10 unlockable each worlds, slower-paced [gameplay](https://geometrylite.io/news/gameplay), and smoother challenges for casual players.

## **Geometry Worlds – A Dash Adventure for All Skill Levels**

Geometry Worlds is a unique fan-made take on the popular Geometry Dash series. This game is ideal for gamers who enjoy rhythmic platformers but prefer a gentler introduction. It preserves the core features while lowering the difficulty. Instead than being thrust into ultra-fast turmoil, you'll travel through ten meticulously constructed worlds, each with a softer learning curve and dynamic visual flare.

### How to play

Your mission is simple: Lead your shape-shifting emblem to the finish line while avoiding obstacles. As in the original, your [cube](https://geometrylite.io/tag/cube) alters as it passes through portals, becoming spacecraft, balls, or other forms, each with its own physics and movement.

**Controls:**

Click, Spacebar, or Tap to jump or fly upward based on the form.
