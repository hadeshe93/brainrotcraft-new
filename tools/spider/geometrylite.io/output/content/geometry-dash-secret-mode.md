Geometry Dash: Secret Mode is a recently found mode in the Geometry Dash universe—can you master the art of precision throws and escape each portal?

## **Geometry Dash: Secret Mode - Discover the Mysterious**

A group of in-world scientists discovered a hidden gameplay element in Geometry Dash: Secret Mode, providing a new challenge unlike any other! This isn't your typical dash; instead, use precise inertia to launch your [cube](https://geometrylite.io/tag/cube) back into a portal. It's the only method to move through stages.

### **How to play**

- Throw the levitating cube through the portal to advance to the next stage.
- Beware of traps scattered throughout each level, as they will obstruct your route and test your timing.
- Stay inside the limits: if your cube crosses the red line, you lose control and the level becomes hard to complete.
