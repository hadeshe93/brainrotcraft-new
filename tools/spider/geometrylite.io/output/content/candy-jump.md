**Candy Jump** is a colorful barrier skill game that tests your timing and reflexes as you try to guide a piece of candy past obstacles that match its color.

## About Candy Jump 

**Candy Jump** takes players in a vibrant, candy-filled environment. In this easy jumping game, you have to demonstrate your ability to maneuver a piece of candy around different obstacles by making sure it only goes through barriers that are the same color as the candy. The candy will shatter and you will have to start again if it runs into barriers of different colors. The gameplay is straightforward at first, but as you aspire for greater scores, it gets more difficult and addictive.

## How to play

To make your candy jump over gaps in the wall, click on it. Make sure the candy only travels through the portions of the wall that correspond to its color. As you advance, the speed and frequency of the color changes increase, so it's important to remember to time your jumps precisely.
