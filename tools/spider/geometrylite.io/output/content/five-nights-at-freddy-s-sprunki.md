The FNAF characters and the strange Spunki are combined in the new and innovative music game Five Nights at Freddy's Sprunki.

## Introduce Gameplay of Five Nights at Freddy's Sprunki 

Five Nights at Freddy's Sprunki is a unique version of the popular music game [Sprunki Incredibox](https://geometrylite.io/sprunki-incredibox) that combines two well-known horror games, FNAF and Sprunki. That seems interesting, right? Once again, you will be transported to a scary musical journey as they play the position of a security guard at the new Sprunki attraction. The gameplay will alter slightly since the musical combo will not be limited to the standard Sprunki characters. 

### How to play

To play, simply drag and drop characters and customize the pre-set instruments and sounds. You can change the volume, pitch, and remix the song to your preference. Robots, dolls, and other characters from the popular [FNAF](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fnaf) series will also take part. You will be able to blend all of these personalities into one piece of music to create your composition.
