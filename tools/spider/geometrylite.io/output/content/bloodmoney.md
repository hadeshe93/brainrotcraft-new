In **BLOODMONEY!**, every click brings both profit and consequence. This isn’t your typical idle clicker—it’s a dark, satirical journey that plays on desperation, indulgence, and the eerie humor of moral decay.

## **BLOODMONEY! - A Disturbingly Addictive Clicker**

In this horror-themed [clicker](https://geometrylite.io/clicker.games), you take on the role of someone desperately needing $25,000 for life-saving surgery. Harvey Harvington offers a bizarre solution: $1 per click, but each click causes him agony. The experience evolves quickly as upgrades become increasingly vicious tools of harm, offering higher payouts but also intensifying psychological tension.

### **Three Paths, Three Consequences**

Narrative depth comes through three possible endings that reflect how far you’re willing to push Harvey:

- Good Ending: Avoid the most dangerous weapons and reach $25,000 with minimal harm.
- Normal Ending: Use moderate upgrades, accepting moral compromise for gain.
- Bad Ending: Go full throttle with the gun, crossing ethical lines—and suffering the aftermath.

### **The Tools of Torture**

The game’s mechanics cleverly intertwine greed with escalating violence. Weapons like a feather, needle, hammer, scissors, match, knife, and ultimately a gun unlock progressively greater cash per click—ranging from a gentle $2 to a brutal $20 per click—but come with growing moral and emotional weight.
