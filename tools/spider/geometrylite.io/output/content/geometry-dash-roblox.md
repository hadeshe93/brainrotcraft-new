Welcome to Geometry Dash ROBLOX. This is a unique take on the popular Geometry Dash game. In this version, instead of the traditional cube, you take on the iconic [Roblox](https://geometrylite.io/tag/roblox) figure.

## **Geometry Dash Roblox – A Fan-Made Fusion of Rhythm and Creation**

Geometry Dash ROBLOX is a fan-made version of the original Geometry Dash with a creative twist on the main character. The essential gameplay stays unchanged: tap to jump, avoid spikes, soar through portals, and survive heart-pounding levels set to upbeat electronic music. The basic idea is the same as the original Geometry Dash, but the main character is a Roblox character, which adds a funny and interesting twist that fans of both games will enjoy.

### **Why You Should Play Geometry Dash ROBLOX?**

This game is an excellent crossover for lovers of both titles. It combines the excitement and complexity of Geometry Dash with the fun and familiarity of the Roblox realm. Whether you're looking for high scores or simply want to see Roblox fly through EDM-fueled pandemonium, this version is worth a try.
