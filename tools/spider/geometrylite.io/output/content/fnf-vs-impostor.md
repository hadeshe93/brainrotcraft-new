In a different Friday Night Funkin mod called **FNF Vs. Impostor**, Boyfriend, and Impostor from Among Us engage in a tense musical battle.

## About FNF Vs. Impostor 

A new version of [FNF](https://geometrylite.io/tag/fnf) featuring Impostor, one of the most well-known characters from the Among Us universe, has been released. Even though your opponent is a skilled impostor, be swept up in the intensity of the moment and prepare to test your rhythm once more. If you want to defeat your rival and surprise your lover to win her love back, then this is an audition for your musical prowess. The gameplay remains unchanged from previous modes: show off your ability to feel every note while submerging yourself in the world of music.

## How to play

Press WASD or the arrow keys following the screen notes.

Based on how well you perform during each song, you'll receive Beans as compensation. With this, you can get additional songs or cosmetics, such as skins and pets.
