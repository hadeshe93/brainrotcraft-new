## **Neon Leap - A World of Light and Shadows**

Neon Leap is about rhythm and control. Players swing, leap, and shift left or right to maneuver through a series of geometric challenges. Each jump feels weighty, as a mistimed move could send your stickman tumbling into the abyss.

Players swing, jump, and dash through abstract neon stages where every [obstacle](https://geometrylite.io/tag/obstacle) shines brightly against a dark backdrop.
