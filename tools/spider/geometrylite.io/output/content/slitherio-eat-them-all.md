## Immerse Yourself in The Multiplayer Game - Slitherio: Eat them all

**Slitherio: Eat them all** is a variation of the well-known Slither.io game, which was introduced by creator Steve Howse in 2016. Due to its straightforward yet captivating gameplay, the game has gained popularity worldwide since its release. The gameplay is based on the traditional snake game premise, but it has been updated with stunning, vibrant graphics. 

## How to play

Put in your name and begin playing competitively with people from all over the world! Control a [snake](https://geometrylite.io/tag/snake) and make your way through a large arena that is full of glowing orbs and snake food. To make your snake longer, you must consume as many of these orbs as you can. 

### The Best Strategies for Success 

Being the largest worm is the aim, and the larger the worm, the larger it will get as you consume more of it. Beating the largest opponents in the arena is the winning tactic. To destroy the opponent, you must force them to collide with your body: A large snake will crash into you if you run parallel to it, use the boost to pass it, and then make a sudden turn to cut it off. You can then consume it!
