**Geometry Dash Adrift** is a 3-star [Normal](https://geometrylite.io/tag/normal) level by TamaN, closing the Force Pack with dark visuals, mini-sized gameplay, and three hidden user coins. 

## **Introduction Geometry Dash Adrift**

Geometry Dash Adrift brings the [Force Pack](https://geometrylite.io/tag/force-pack) to a dramatic close with its moody atmosphere and shrunken gameplay. As the third and final level in the Force Pack, Adrift completes the trilogy in memorable fashion. The level uses a blue and black color scheme that enhances its dark, gloomy vibe. This aesthetic makes Adrift stand out, as it contrasts heavily with the more vibrant designs of ColorZ and other Force Pack entries. 

### **User Coins**

For completionists, Adrift offers three cleverly hidden user coins:

- 38% (Mini-UFO): Fly upward in the second mini-UFO segment; the block in front disappears once the coin is taken.
- 47% (Mini-Cube): Avoid the obvious jump and land on an invisible platform to reveal the coin.
- 84% (Wave): Steer upward through a spiked tunnel in the wave section to grab the last coin.

### **Why Players Remember Adrift**

Beyond its mechanics, players appreciate the dark tone and clever coin placements. It feels like a level that tests observation as much as reaction, offering a slightly different flavor from other Force Pack levels.
