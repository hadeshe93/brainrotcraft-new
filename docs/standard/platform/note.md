## 6. Viral Content Strategies

Based on research by Jonah Berger, viral content on note follows six key elements:

**Social Currency (社会的通貨)**
Content that makes readers look knowledgeable, insightful, or "in the know" when they share it. Professional insights and expertise create social currency.

**Triggers (きっかけ)**
Content connected to everyday situations or current events that remind people to think about and share it.

**Emotion (感情)**
Content that evokes strong emotional responses, whether awe, surprise, humor, or empathy. Emotional engagement drives sharing.

Visible, observable content that others can see and imitate. Ideas that are built to show, built to grow.

**Practical Value (実用的価値)**
Useful information that helps people solve problems or improve their lives. "How-to" content and actionable advice perform well.

**Stories (ストーリー)**
Narratives that carry information within an engaging story. People share stories, not statistics.

### 6.2 Tactical Approaches

**Emotional Appeal**
Design content with emotional hooks using humor, surprise, inspiration, or empathy.

**Competitive Analysis**
Study successful content in your niche and find differentiation points.

**User Participation**
Create contests, campaigns, or calls-to-action that invite audience participation.

**Strategic Sharing**
Articles do not end when written. Creators must actively share their work on social media and other channels.

**Popularity Signals**
Display articles in "popularity order" on creator profile pages to leverage social proof. This has been shown to increase article click rates.
