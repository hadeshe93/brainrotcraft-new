"""
I recently developed a free online tool for removing backgrounds from images, supporting both single and batch image processing. For batch operations, there is currently a limit of 12 images per session for anonymous users and 20 images per session for logged-in users. The original intention of this project is that most online tools have restrictions on image resolution, or do not allow downloading the original image after processing, or add watermarks.

At present, there are no paid plans set up, and I would like to ask everyone for advice on what kind of pricing model would be more reasonable. This is because I want most users who only need to process a few images to avoid having to pay for platforms with so many restrictions.

You can check it out here: https://freebackgroundremover.net/
Click "Bulk Editor" in the navigation bar to switch to the batch processing page.

- Content: Try https://freebackgroundremover.net/bulk-editor. Currently, batch processing is free. As an anonymous user, you can process up to 12 images at a time; after logging in, you can process up to 20 images at a time, and the speed is very fast.


现在请你实现客户端逻辑，主要使用位置为 @src/modules/background-remover/components/bulk/files-editor.tsx 中的 L41，请参考 TODO 注释来完成。ultrathink

要求：
- 由于注册 -> 分批批量上传 -> 轮询这几部分相对独立，请在 @src/modules/background-remover/lib/ 目录下创建文件来分模块实现，最终使用组合的方式来降低函数之间的耦合程度；
- 最后如果成功的话，还需要修改 @src/modules/background-remover/components/bulk/files-editor.tsx 中的 `onDownloadAll` 逻辑，因为对于服务端产生的 ZIP 文件，直接下载一个就够了。
